                <p><situation>Visual Albums such as Kanye West’s Runway and the Beatles’ A Hard Day
                        Night have put the music industry on it’s head.</situation> Since A Hard Day

                        Albums bring the writer closer to the reader in a way that exceeds other

                            you'll elaborate on that in the essay itself</note>.</argument>
                </p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara><context>The values that this genre focuses on is to be the best in your
                    field, as most artists release a song by itself, others go the extra mile by
                    making a music video, and only a select few go even further and release a visual
                    album.</context> The scene and situation help us understand the story more
                through the genre that is being used. <scene>Using Beyoncé’s Lemonade as a well
                    established scene from this genre<note type="instructor">I think you are
                        minunderstanding the relationship between scene, situation and genre. See
                        our early discussions and vocab list for clarification; my understanding is
                        that situations exist within scenes, and situations are coordinated through
                        genres--meaning a single text (i.e. Lemonade) isn't an example of a scene,
                        but rather operates in a particular scene or scenes (the music industry, US
                        popular culture, media, etc.), and responds to a particular recurrent
                        situation within that scene.</note>, you can see the impact of her choosing
                    visual albums as her platform.<note type="instructor">platform for what? what is
                        the recurrent situation that this genre responds to within the
                    scene?</note></scene>
                <participants>This genre helped Beyoncé reach out to her fans in a much more direct
                    way by being very personal and in touch with the current times,</participants>
                <situation>which created a long discussion about some of the situations that were
                    exposed in Lemonade, such as the very famous lyrics from the song Sorry “He only
                    want me when I'm not there. He better call Becky with the good hair”.
                    </situation><note type="instructor">it seems to me that the discussion following
                    the release of the visual album should be considered uptake rather than
                    situation</note></bodyPara>
            <bodyPara><participants>Singers, artists, poets, and public speakers are not the only
                    people who use this genre. There are also the directors and musical engineers
                    who in charge of development and upgrading the elements within the
                    genre.</participants> Going back to the previously mentioned situation, Lemonade
                featured the Somali-English poet Warsaw Shire in one of it’s chapters.
                    <context>Warsaw Shire uses the genre of Visual Albums to input her own personal
                    situation which many people including Beyoncé related to, this demonstrates how
                    she uses her own uptake of combining her poetry with the sub-genre of
                        video.<note type="instructor">I think you're close to an interesting claim
                        here, but again, I am confused how you are using our key vocabulary. What do
                        you mean by uptake here? It may help to define terms more thoroughly in your
                        essay</note></context> People who do not have the talent or ideas to make a
                visual albums can not use this genre, however they make up a vast majority of
                readers of this genre.<note type="instructor">okay, but didn't you just say that a
                    poet (someone who doesn't have the 'skills' to make a visual album i.e. probably
                    can't sing/make music) participated. What evidence do you have for this
                    claim?</note></bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>Visual Albums invite many different uptakes that help the artist connect to as
                many people as possible. Uptakes in visual albums work as a medium for the writers
                to express their feelings in a wide range of oppertunities. These uptakes include
                the use of song and video, the use of old tribal dances in a contemporary music
                video, and the combination of poetry and speech with visuals.<note type="instructor"
                    >Okay, I'm trying to follow here, but you aren't providing any concrete evidence
                    for this claim.</note>
                <situation>The use of song and video together encompasses the genres of visual
                    albums and music videos, as both are very similar concepts. Using this
                        uptake<note type="instructor">you seem to be using this term to describe a

                    convey to the audience.</situation><note type="instructor">why is this
                    situation?</note>
                <scene>Going back to Lemonade, Beyoncé uses visuals eluding to feelings of sadness
                    and betrayal in the song Pray You Catch Me to convey her situation of being
                    cheated on.</scene>
                <situation>The use of old tribal dances and contemporary music as an uptake gives
                    the artist a way to demonstrate their<note type="instructor">are you still
                        specifically talking about Lemonade here?</note> background and culture to a
                    much bigger platform of readers.</situation><scene>
                    <citation source="#Ori">Beyoncé mixes the two together in the song Sorry by
                        performing an old tribal dance called The Sacred Art of Ori, which showed

                        quotes and citation for the in-text citation</note>.</scene>
                <situation>Last but not least, the use of spoken word and visuals gives a deeper
                    understanding of what the speaker is trying to convey, or the artists’
                    interpretation of the different speakers they use.</situation><note
                    type="instructor">how is this situation?</note><scene>
                    <citation source="#Malclom">Beyoncé uses an excerpt from a speech given by
                        Malcolm X in May 22, 1962 with visuals of various black women to emphasize
                        the importance of the speech to the black community and especially to black
                        women. </citation><note type="instructor">why do you need a citation here?
                        Also, where is the analysis; I don't understand how the inclusion of the
                        speech is evidence of your claim that spoken word and visuals combine to
                        give the audience a "deeper understanding" or "the artist's
                        interpretation"</note></scene></bodyPara>

            <p>Good, catchy start to the introduction to keep the reader engaged and interested in
                the analysis. It’s good that you provided some background to the topic. Slightly
                awkward layout of the introduction, should all be in one paragraph. Good referencing
                from a particular song and video, shows that you have knowledge in the topic. How
                does Beyoncé making a visual album help her connect with her fans in a more direct
                way? Explain (para 2 last sentence). Consider expanding on how the scene and
                situation helps us understand the story more through the genre that is being used.
                Maybe define uptake in terms of your genre and in light of your analysis for us to
                understand the concept better rather than its generic meaning. Valid use of genre in
                most of the essay. Would be a good idea if you briefly describe a music video so
                that the reader doesn’t have to watch it to understand what you mean by feelings of
                sadness and betrayal. I like how you mentioned that Beyoncé used old tribal dances
                and contemporary music as an uptake and explained it. Except for the introduction, I
                like how you’ve structured your paragraphs with new ideas/ topics in each paragraph.
                Good job in linking your new ideas to ideas mentioned previously. Valid points made
                throughout the essay. I like how you elaborated on the importance of the roles of
                both the reader and the writer. Good understanding of the deeper implications of her
                Visual Albums and song lyrics. Would be a good idea to replace “uses an excerpt
                from” to “alludes to” in the fourth paragraph. Another note, “eluding to a feelings”
                delete the “a”. Overall I enjoyed the essay as it is about a contemporary artist and
                her personal and profession life. Good use of literary terms and key terms such as
                genre and uptake (as discussed during class). Would like it if you considered
                changing the points mentioned above. .</p>

            <p>So I find this an interesting topic, but I often struggled to follow your claims in
                the essay. The biggest issue, in my opinion, is your use of the key vocabulary words
                of genre analysis. See my in-text comments above for examples and specifics, but I
                am not sure how you are using scene, situation, and uptake in your essay. As your
                reviewer mentioned, it might be a good idea to define these with respect to your
                genre. I think you actually misuse the term "scene" and the term "situation"
                throughout the essay. See lengthy comment above on the relation between scene,
                situation, and genre as articulated in the class and through the readings. You did
                make some interesting claims, but struggled to connect specific evidence to those
                claims with sustained analysis. If you revise, one route you might take is to reduce
                the number of claims you make and spend more time elaborating your strongest claims.
                I think the idea of uptake is a powerful one here--Beyonce's uptake of previous
                genres to create a hybrid genre; the public's uptake of certain lyrics/images in the
                visual album and how those circulate in the media, etc. etc. You could easily write
                this paper on that. Lastly, you often make very generalized claims that lack
                evidence at all. For example, the writer's role is to make an impact on readers.
                What does this mean? All writers? Musical artists? Beyonce? It is just too vague an
                assertion to really prove in any meaningful way.</p>
            <p>I'm happy to talk more about the essay and help you revise if you choose to do
                so.</p>
