        <intro>
            <evidence type="anecdote">I remember being a child and hearing my parents arguing about
                whether or not to leave our home in order to come to U.S. My mom, a teacher, was
                sick of the conditions at her school (and every other school for that matter) (rats,
                no toilet paper, lack of staff, no materials, etc). My dad, a manager at an
                engineering firm, was afraid of losing his job. As if all of that wasn’t enough,
                crime was so high that they didn’t even feel safe in their gated community living
                right next door to a police officer. They realistically could not afford to raise
                their new family and were dismayed by the options they had to educate their
                children. So, in July of 2009, they made the hard decision to leave their family and
                home country to give their children a better chance at life. </evidence>This story
            resonates with the thousands upon thousands of families who have emigrated from Puerto
            Rico in the past decade because of the Island’s worsening conditions. <note

            <bg_info>Puerto Rico is currently in a state of emergency. The public debt, which the
                Island’s Governor called “unsayable”, has reached a staggering $73 billion and
                continues to grow. <evidence type="statistics"> Unemployment is at a dismal 14%, and
                    46 % of the island’s inhabitants are living below the poverty line, a rate
                    higher than that of any of the States. </evidence>. <opinion type="general"
                    >Puerto Rico’s recent surge in emigration, which is largely due to the economic
                    crisis, is an exodus of historic proportions.</opinion> This mass departure of
                inhabitants leads to the island’s tax base being significantly reduced and therefore
                puts incredible strain on the already weak economy. This negatively affects the
                remaining residents by making them shoulder higher taxes while dealing with the
                Island’s dwindling social resources (less hospitals, less schools, less
                professionals).</bg_info>
        </body_para>

        <body_para>
            <opinion type="general">This weakened economy is caused mostly by, in my opinion, the
                Island’s status as a colony. </opinion>
            <evidence type="supporting">Because we are neither a state nor an independent country,
                we cannot seek help from international debt handling agencies.</evidence>
            <opinion type="general">Because we are not at all able to declare bankruptcy, it really
                feels like watching the economy crash and burn is inevitable. </opinion>This is only
            part of the problem though. <evidence type="supporting">Our economy is both limited by
                and dependent on the U.S. Because of all of the federal laws and regulations we are
                forced to follow, we have no control over our own fiscal or trade policies.
                Furthermore, the island has no representation in congress, meaning that when
                decisions are made for our island’s residents, their needs are not taking into
                account.</evidence>All of this combined leads to the conclusion that even if the
            island were to decide that it wants to be its own independent country, they would not
            even have the necessary infrastructure to be able to thrive on its own. </body_para>

            <bg_info><evidence type="supporting">Since the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, they
                    have exploited us for their convenience. From the Ponce Massacre and the use of
                    Vieques as a bomb target practice to government programs which forced Puerto
                    Rican women to be sterilized and allowed prisoners to be unethically tested on
                    with radiation, the U.S. government has an incriminating list of trangressions
                    against the island’s people. All of these acts against the island have lead to
                    the destruction of our land, increased rates of cancer and birth defects, as
                    well as the destruction of people’s lives (both literally and metaphorically).
                    Yet, because we have no representation or sovereignty, a lot of these issues are
                    swept under the rug and ignored.</evidence></bg_info>

        <body_para>
            <opinion type="general">All other arguments aside, statehood has never really been an
                option for Puerto Rico. </opinion>
            <bg_info>We are a Commonwealth of the United States, an unincorporated organized
                territory. This basically means that we belong to, but are not a part of, the U.S.
                Unlike Alaska and Hawaii, which were “incorporated” territories with the intention
                of joining the Union and becoming states,</bg_info>
            <opinion type="general">the decision to keep Puerto Rico as “unincorporated” looks to me
                like politician’s sneaky way of avoiding deeming granting us statehood. Now more
                than ever, with Trump as our president elect and a mostly republican government,
                statehood seems like a pipe dream. There is no way we, an overwhelmingly Democratic,
                non-white, non-solely-English speaking island with massive debt would be allowed
                into a country on it’s way to being “Great Again”.</opinion>
        </body_para>

        <body_para>
            <situation>In June of this year, President Obama signed a bill that would “rescue”
                Puerto Rico from our economic crisis.</situation>
            <bg_info><evidence type="supporting"> This bill, the the Puerto Rico Oversight,
                    Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) puts the entire economy in
                    charge of a yet-to-be-appointed seven person board. The board is supposed to
                    oversee negotiations with the Island’s creditors, create of a fiscal plan (which
                    must include the funding of the island’s pensions, <evidence type="statistics"
                        >currently underfunded by more than $40 billion</evidence>), and restructure
                    our debt, among other things.</evidence>
            </bg_info>
            <opinion type="general">The passing of this bill strips the residents and officials of
                the island of the very little control they have, and provides them with basically no
                control over the commonwealth's future. This is exactly the opposite of what the
                island really needs. While PROMESA may help whittle away at the island’s enormous
                debt, it doesn’t put the island on a path toward the sort of economic growth that
                could help the island thrive on its own.</opinion>
        </body_para>

        <body_para>
            <opinion type="critique">I think independence is the long term solution to the island’s
                problems, as not feasible as it seems right now. Independence would allow Puerto
                Rico to deal with the debt crisis on its own terms while allowing he island's
                residents to have a say in how the future of their home pans out. It would allow
                elected officials at all levels of government make decisions with lasting effects,
                this would give power back to the people who actually live on the island. </opinion>
        </body_para>

        <conclusion>For too long, Puerto Ricans have been victims to the United States. We have
            chosen to stay in a broken yet comfortable state because we are afraid of revolutionary
            change. A slow but steady transition to independence, like that of Singapore and the
            Philippines, would allow both the U.S. and P.R. to adjust to a new and improved,
            self-governing Puerto Rico. Independece, as hard as it would be, would prevent thousands
            upon thousands of families from having to make the even harder decision to leave theor
            families in search for better lives. </conclusion>

            <p>This Op-Ed describes the current economic and emergent state in Puerto Rico. The main
                opinion stated here is that the economic situation is so dire because of Puerto
                Rico's status as a colony, which disables them from seeking help from institutions
                such as the IMF. My overall opinion of this Op-Ed is that it is a current global
                problem, and therefore a very interesting read. I find that the fact that this
                article comes from personal experience makes me want to read on, and though the bulk
                of the article is factual, the first paragraph is a definite hook and made me want
                to read about the state of Puerto Rico, and why so many families make the difficult
                decision to move to America. The xml tags that have been put in are well placed. As
                for critique, I would suugest that she include a photo, as that would be a great
                addition to the piece. I also think that maybe including a little bit more towards
                the end referring back to her personal experiences would take this article full
                circle and the one piece of advice I would give is to make us of the background tag,
                and the evidence tags, particularly statistics, as there are alot of those included
                in the piece. I would also suggest that some of the paragraphs be pushed together a
                bit more, as sometimes it can seem a bit spread out.</p>

            <p>This is a model op-ed. It is a timely, important topic and you provide ample
                background to establish your claims. You also do a great job with evidence. Really,
                really nice work. I especially like how you use Spanish, even in a limited way, in
                your title and body. It is a very effective rhetorical device in this case. I'd love
                to share this with future classes, if you're willing. On the XML side, it doesn't
                look like you made any of the changes to your XML document that were a result of the
                changes to the schema. So you have a bunch of validation errors. These should be
                easy to fix up.</p>
