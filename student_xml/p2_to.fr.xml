                Hocus Pocus( 1993) was the second film former dance choreographer Kenny Ortega directed. 
                Ortega has since mostly worked in TV but has had other successes with the Disney Channel TV movie High School Musical (2006)
                and sequels, as well as the Michael Jackson documentary This Is It (2009). <synopsis type = "plot_points">Hocus Pocus tells the story of the Sanderson sisters
                , a trio of witches named Winifred, Mary, and Sarah, played by Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker respectively.
                These witches were hung in 1693 by the townspeople of Salem for stealing children. 300 years later, a teen named Max, played by
                Omri Katz, moves to Salem with his family from Los Ageles, California. He is very skeptical of the legend of the Sanderson sisters, 
                so on Halloween night 1993, his crush and true believer Allison, played by Vinessa Shaw, takes Max and his little sister Dani, played 
                by Thora Birch, to the Sanderson house where, if a virgin lights the black flame candle on Halloween, legend has it the sisters will 
                return from the grave. Being the skeptic that he is, Max lights the candle, inadvertently bringing the Sanderson Sisters back to life. 
                In order to stay alive, the sisters must suck the life out of a child using a spell from their book. Now, Max, Allison, Dani, and a 
                cursed cat named Thackery, voiced by Jason Marsden, must keep them from getting this book.</synopsis>

                    Hocus Pocus was not the first time that Disney had made a film about witches – they having made everything from Snow White and the
                    Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959) to The Sword in the Stone (1963) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Of all of these,
                    Hocus Pocus seems the most trivial.Sure, it has some flashy effects – witches flying on broomsticks, a CGI talking cat, a book with a 
                    living eye, Bette Midler morphing into a stone gargoyle at the climax – but there is no awe to the effects, nothing that supports them, 
                    they are empty and generated solely for their own sake. Beneath this, there is little in the way of story – it consists mostly of people
                    running around connected only by a series of thin plot devices. The Disney name adds a layer of  “niceness” over everything so that it 
                    never gets too scary for children: the witches are played so moronically there is no chance they can appear threatening, the zombie turns
                    out to be a nice guy, and everything is wrapped up happily at the ending.

                    The film also bends itself in irritatingly chronologically incorrect ways for the purpose of laughs – so that Bette Midler might get a chance 
                    to sing, the film conveniently provides her with a stage and microphone and allows the other two sisters to become a backing chorus; they 
                    developing instant familiarity with 20th Century technology and musical styles despite having been revived out of the 17th Century for less 
                    than a day. Later on as Omri Katz flees Bette Midler in a car while she pursues on a broomstick, she makes jarringly anachronistic references
                    to his lack of driver’s licensce (“Let me see a driver’s permit”) and to arresting him for speeding (“resisting arrest?”).

                    I found this movie to be pretty creepy sexually. Max is your typical randy tween — a virgin, as the film constantly reminds us — whose primary 
                    motivation is to impress Allison (Vinessa Shaw), a girl in his class. Many movies start off this way, but few include cringe-inducing scenes 
                    where the protagonist pretends a pillow is the object of his affection and spoons it while whispering, "Oh, Allison, you're so soft." Hocus
                    Pocus is a Disney movie, and Max is dry-humping his bedding. That's alarming. But what's even stranger is that this is a movie written by adults 
                    for children. Why are scenes like this necessary? To really drive home the point that Max likes Allison? Hocus Pocus is obsessed with his virginity,
                    per the fact that according to legend, only virgins can light candles that bring the witches back. But the movie repeatedly reminds us of his virgin 
                    status, and also reminds us that he acts in irrational and dumb ways because he seems so desperate to lose it.

                    The entire movie gives off the impression of having been staged as a way for Bette Midler to shine. Bette Midler obtained critical acclaim as an actress
                    in the Janis Joplin-based The Rose (1979). In buck-toothed, eyes permanently wide open, and Queen Anne hairstyle fashion, Midler shamelessly out-shines 
                    Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy, the results of which become watchable in a bizarre way after awhile. (Although, for all Bette Midler’s appeal 
                    as a singer, the best song in the movie comes from Sarah Jessica Parker, a melodic sequence sung from on her broom to draw the town’s children to their
                    deaths). The best acting comes the less ostentatious players – from Omri Katz who makes an appealing and convincing teen hero and a young Thora Birch 
                    who plays off him with authentic emotion as his younger sister. Vinessa Shaw starts out well but once the action starts, the film forgets about her 
                    entirely and allows her to become no more than part of the scenery.

                When Hocus Pocus debuted more than 20 years
                ago, it made $39 million — a meager number compared with the $28 million Disney poured into its production. The movie was a disappointment, 
                opening at fourth place behind peers like Jurassic Park and Free Willy.
