    <docReview>
        <reviewer type="peer" xml:id="li_em"> Emma Lindberg</reviewer>
        <report type="peer" who="#li_em">
            <p>Your resume is clear, well-formatted and is ordered in a way that makes sense. One
                thing you can focus on for revisions is rewording some vague statements. Under
                "Research Assistant," you wrote, "utilized many modern equipment and can easily
                learn how to operate new devices." If this was actually to be presented to a
                potential employer, they may question exactly what you mean by that. Instead, you
                could say something like "learned and mastered (some relevant type of equipment) in
                (some amount of time). It is conveying the same message but it sounds for credible
                because it is listing a specific thing in a specific time.</p>

            <p> Another thing to maybe take a second look at is your objective, which I think could
                be a little more focused and tailored for the desired position. I do not know much
                better than you, but it could be off-putting to an employer if you say up front that
                you only want to work there for a max fours years, until you get the knowledge you
                need to open your own practice. As a student still in school, looking to gain
                experience is an expected objective. But for someone who is already and established
                doctor, you should present a goal that goes past just looking for experience. Maybe
                say something more on the lines of "seeking to bring my skills and experience to
                your hospital in order to help patients throughout their recovery experience. Or,
                instead of an objective (or an addition to an objective) you could have a summary of
                why you are a great psychiatrist by saying something "X amount o years of experience
                dedicated to children's recovery through extensive research, acute attention to
                individual patients' needs, and collaborating with colleagues to reach solutions to
                various problems."</p>

            <p>Since the resume is so basic and familiar, and because you clearly have a solid
                draft, I looked at more subtle things that could be improved. But overall, a very good draft!</p>
