            <p> Summary: You have several title ideas for his article. Some are relatable to
                Northeastern and/or college students, while others are universal to anyone.
                
                Critique/Eval: Titles are the most important part of these satirical articles, so I
                think it is understandable that you only have titles to be reviewed. I definitely
                favor some over the others, and I also like the idea of doing an article that is
                related to college. My favorite is the Game of Thrones one. If you were to use that
                one, I would suggest omitting “only” and “his” so it reads” Incredible! Student
                Manages to Watch Entire Game of Thrones Series During Chemistry Lectures.” It is not
                a big deal, but I think it just sounds a little bit more synthesized. I do really
                like the “Incredible!” because it reflects The Onion’s wording. You could
                sarcastically comment on the tuition money being wasted, quotes from other students
                in his class, etc. 
                
                I also liked the other college-themed titles, including the
                ResLife one and the coughing one. It is really just a matter of figuring out how to
                elaborate on them. I also like the “Scientists Agree That Pigs Will Likely Never
                Fly.” I think that is a really clever title, and gets to the type of humor Onion has
                in some of its random/wtf articles that satirize a random part of society, like the
                saying “when pigs fly.” The athlete/rape one is definitely a relevant topic in
                society, but maybe overdone/time already passed. The computer science one is also
                really funny, but maybe only really relevant to a small crowd (computer science
                majors), which isn’t a huge deal, just something to consider. The Harambe one is
                actually kind of funny even though I think Harambe jokes should've never been a
                thing. But the title is funny mainly because I think someone could actually believe it. The Gary Johnson
                one is also funny, so it is just a matter of being able to elaborate 
                
                Overall, you presented a wide range of article titles that touch upon different types of humor
                that come from The Onion. My suggestion would be to maybe pick a couple titles to
                write articles for, then decide which one comes out stronger. </p>
