                    <synopsis type="themes"> The story of Outsourced begins with the main character, Todd Anderson, 
                        being let go from his current job as the manager of a call center. His boss tells him his job 
                        is being outsourced and he'll need to go to India to train the man that will eventually replace
                        him. He is initially against this idea, but his boss says he'll lose his employee and health 
                        benefits if he doesn't so he flies to Mumbai to live there until the employees at the new call
                        center are trained.</synopsis>
                    <synopsis type="plot_points"> Todd experiences culture shock instantly upon arriving in India, and has trouble
                    with viewing their culture in relation to his own.</synopsis>
                    Todd views his way of doing things as the default and normal way, and struggles
                    to adapt. As he begins to understand Indian culture more, he gains respect for
                    the employees and appoints a woman named Asha to be Puro’s assistant. <opinions
                        type="reaction">The pacing may seem slow towards the beginning of the movie,
                        but gradually the speed picks up and we begin to learn more about Todd and
                        the way the employees interact with each other. The scenes highlighting the
                        misunderstandings between Todd and the employees about the origin of the
                        products they're selling or how to relate to the customers they're talking
                        to back in the US help display this and are some of the most interesting
                        parts of the movie.</opinions>
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">Todd convinces his boss to start
                    sending the company’s products to India so the employees can be rewarded for
                    their work and their business can grow in another country.</synopsis>
                    The products are sent to an island also called Gharapuri, and Todd and Asha have
                    to retrieve them.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">The ferry they were going to take back to land catches on fire, and Todd and Asha
                    have to stay at a hotel, where they begin to fall in love. Later Asha explains
                    to Todd that her marriage has already been arranged since she was young. When
                    Todd’s boss arrives in India, he informs Todd that the call center jobs are
                    being outsourced to China. The employees are all let go, but they’ve been
                    trained well enough to pursue jobs for other companies. Todd refuses to go to
                    China, but he sends Puro to go in his place. Asha tells Todd that if she doesn’t love the man she is engaged to
                    she will come to the USA. At the end of the movie, Todd gets a call from Asha in
                    his apartment back home.</synopsis>

                    <opinions type="reaction">As Todd begins to learn more about Indian culture, and
                        the members of the call center learn more about his own culture, the
                        audience gets to see an example of people from two very different
                        backgrounds communicating and relating. The movie does a great job of
                        highlighting the experiences of both someone moving to a new place with a
                        much different culture, and the experiences of people that have someone from
                        another culture interact with theirs. Some of the main events could be
                        perceived as unrealistic, such as the ferry catching on fire, but the
                        relationships formed by Todd and those around him are the primary focus of
                        the film. The relationship between Todd and Asha serves as the centerpiece
                        of the movie, and details an endearing story of learning to live with loving
                        someone that was raised much differently than you.</opinions>
                </p>
                <p> One of the biggest strengths of Outsourced is that the relationships of the main
                    characters seem genuine. The conversations and misunderstandings Todd has with
                    his employees are realistic and relatable, and the love affair between Todd and
                    Asha draws the audience in. This can be credited to stellar performances by
                        <context type="actor">Josh Hamilton</context> and <context type="actor">
                        Ayesha Dharker</context> in their portrayals of Todd and Asha respectively. </p>
                <p>
                    <aesthetics>Some of the visuals of this film can be lackluster, but for an indie
                        film of this variety, graphical effects aren't necessary. Filming took place
                        in Mumbai and Seattle, which are the real settings of the movie. The camera
                        is often focused on Todd, and great care is taken to show his facial
                        expressions and responses to the situations around him. Music is played
                        minimally, because throughout the film there is almost always dialogue that
                        needs to have the audience's full attention.</aesthetics>
                </p>
                <p> Although Outsourced is his most popular movie, director <context type="director"
                        >John Jeffcoat</context> is also known for his more recent film <comparison
                        type="movie">Big in Japan.</comparison> It details a Seattle rock band
                    pursuing their dreams of touring in Japan. <style type="italics">Big in
                        Japan</style> doesn't make as many meaningful statements about people and
                    their differences as Outsourced, but it's easy to follow and comedic. </p>

            <conclusion>
                <p>
                    <opinions type="reaction">Outsourced shines in its ability to accurately portray
                        the experiences of individuals learning about and living with another
                        culture. The interactions between Todd and the people he meets in India are
                        natural, and the relationship between Todd and Asha is both believable and
                        relatable. The plot may seem forced or outlandish at times, but the movie's
                        best attributes are apparent in the dialogue and development of characters.

            <p>Your movie review is on a movie called Outsourced, which is about a man named Todd
                Anderson who loses his job in America and is forced to go to India to train call
                center employees under threat of losing benefits. The movie shows the culture clash
                and how people from very different backgrounds can get along, and even fall in love.
                Much of the first body paragraph is still a synopsis of the movie and I think could
                be moved to the intro. Most of your review focuses on what happened in the movie and
                almost feels more like a movie analysis than a movie review. I like the opinions and
                conclusion paragraphs as they focus on what you liked and disliked about the movie,
                as well as what you thought the movie's greatest strengths were. I think you could
                improve the review by having your reactions being dispersed within the synopsis of
                the movie as the review feels a bit chunky right now. For example, you could bring
                up specific parts you liked and disliked while talking about what happened. I also
                had a little trouble picturing the movie and movie style, so I think it is important
                to have a section on aesthetics which was outlined in the schema. Even just a few
                sentences describing the styles of filming and scene shooting I think would help
                paint a better picture on what the movie experience is like. Also adding the
                director as well as main actors would help to determine if I (the reader of the
                movie review) would want to go see the movie after reading your review. I noticed
                you also cut out some of the conclusion tags that would be easy to throw in such as
                the budget, movie gross, and release date. I know you have the release date in the
                header, but I think adding it again in the end would help place the movie
                chronologically in reader's heads. I really like your title too; it sounds like a
                real review of the movie and definitely would draw people in.</p>
