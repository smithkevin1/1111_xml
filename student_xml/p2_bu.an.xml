                <p><context type="franchise_history">Dating back to 2009's <style type="italics"
                            >Iron Man</style>, Marvel Studios has had a pretty good track record
                        with their re-branding of the classic marvel superheroes. They have been so
                        successful in fact, that they re-popularized the idea of intertwining film
                        continuities with 2012's <style type="italics">The Avengers</style>, coining
                        the phrase “cinematic universe” in the pop culture vernacular.</context> But
                    despite all this, Marvel took a big leap of faith with their experimental film,
                        <style type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style>, <context
                        type="franchise_history">a film based off an extremely obscure Marvel comic
                        series</context>. A big leap that evidently paid off with one of the
                    funniest action movies of all time <note type="peer" who="#ga.ar"> can you
                        rephrase this sentence> </note>.</p>
                <p><synopsis type="plot_points"><style type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style> follows the story of Peter
                    Quill, played by Chris Pratt, a would be treasure space pirate who was abducted
                    from his home at a very young age.
                    After stealing a
                particularly valuable treasure from a crypt, the infinity stone, he gets captured
                and imprisoned and forms a team of criminal mercenaries and assassins in order to
                break out and stop the fanatical space ruler Ronan, played by Lee Pace, from
                harnessing the power of the infinity stone and going on a planet-destroying frenzy.</synopsis></p>
            </intro>
            <body>
                <p><opinions type="reaction">Now, where the real humor and charm of the film comes
                        into play is the cast of unique and hilarious characters and interactions
                        between them. The main team, the self-proclaimed Guardians of the Galaxy,
                        are a fantastic example of this.</opinions> The main cast, the so called
                    “heroes” are no more than psychotic criminals who do good out of necessity and
                    team up do to their shared connection with the film's villain, Thanos. <opinions
                        type="reaction">As such, you get a lot of great moments where all their ugly
                        personalities butt heads and play off one another.</opinions>
                </p>

                <p> Quill is an overconfident and extremely charming talker, who is ultimately good,
                    but is willing to do anything to get his way. Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, is
                    a serious and unemotional, but very skilled, female assassin who previously
                    worked for Ronan. She often plays the straight man to the team's wackier
                    characters. Drax on the other hand, played by Dave Bautista, is a hyper serious
                    warrior who seeks to avenge the death of his family at the hands of Ronan. He
                    spends most of the movie alternating between an intimidating brute and comic
                    relief as he simply does not understand hyperbole or non-literal
                    expressions.</p>

                <p>Finally you get to the duo of Rocket and Groot, played by Bradley Cooper and Vin
                    Diesal respectively. Rocket is a psychotic hyper-intelligent mutant raccoon who
                    is a master engineer and weapons specialist. On top of all that, he is also loud
                    and fouled mouth, but has a surprisingly touching back story. His partner in
                    crime, Groot, is a tree-like humanoid who can only says the words “I am Groot”.
                    Ironically, Groot tends to be the most grounded, and rational one of the whole
                    team. They work together as bounty hunters but join the team in order to break
                    out of prison. </p>

                <p>
                    <opinions type="reaction">Just from the character descriptions, you begin to get
                        the idea of the types of situations that would play out between the extreme
                        personalities. The dialogue is witty, comedic timing is spot on, and the
                        characters, while objectively heinous, are incredibly likable. The acting in
                        the movie is also superb. Every actor seems like a perfect fit for their
                        roles and all act naturally with each other through the film. Both the
                        dialogue and the acting combined makes it seem like you are watching an
                        actual group of friends making jabs at each other and getting along despite
                        their differences.</opinions>
                </p>

                <p><context type="director">What makes this film even more interesting is its
                        director James Gunn. Gunn's background includes a large list of mediocre
                        comedies, like <style type="italics">Scooby-Doo</style> and another
                        superhero film, <style type="italics">Super</style>. All in all, it was a
                        not very promising track record now that he was at the head of a huge summer
                        blockbuster. Which made it all the more surprising just how good <style
                            type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style> turned out to be. It
                        turns out all his time working on self-referential and cheesy films worked
                        greatly in <style type="italics">Guardian of the Galaxy</style>'s favor, as
                        the movie is partly a parody of the superhero-genre while also mimicking
                        it.</context></p>

                <p>
                    <aesthetics><opinions type="reaction"><style type="italics">Guardians of the
                                Galaxy</style>'s visuals are also a sight to behold. Like the cast
                            of characters, everything is colorful. The deep space settings does not
                            discourage the movie from showing off incredibly vibrant colors and
                            locales.</opinions></aesthetics>
                    <comparison type="movie"><opinions type="critique">The visual effects are not
                            mind blowing like 2009's <style type="italics">Avatar</style>, with huge
                            lush landscapes or stunning action sequences, but <style type="italics"
                                >Guardians of the Galaxy</style> certainly does not slack
                            off.</opinions></comparison>
                    <aesthetics><opinions type="reaction">The CG animations are also top notch,
                            especially on completely animated characters like Rocket and Groot,
                            staying expressive despite all the visual
                        effects.</opinions></aesthetics> Finally, you got the action scenes.
                        <opinions type="critique">These are the only parts of the movie that I feel
                        could be improved. While not bad per say, they feel generic and kind of
                        forced in because it is a Marvel superhero movie. There were few fight
                        scenes that stuck out for me and were memorable for the action alone,
                        instead its the dialogue that carries it all.</opinions>
                </p>
            </body>
            <conclusion>
                <p>Overall, <style type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style> is a near spotless
                    action-comedy blockbuster. If you love humorous characters interactions in
                    incredible scenarios, then this is definitely a movie you should watch. Do not
                    expect any sort of deep character development or a thought-provoking plot.
                    Instead go in with an open mind looking for a good, memorable laugh with
                    characters you think were your own friends. I truly believe that Guardians
                    easily takes title of the best second phase Marvel movie, and I am very excited
                    for the sequel coming out next May.</p>
                <p>Guardians of the Galaxy, by Marvel Studios, is <summary type="rating">rated

        <report type="peer" who="#Ga.ar">
            <p> I understand the premise of this genre replication to be based on Guardians of the
                Galaxy, a movie where you focus on the actors, the visuals, and the humor.
                Furthermore, you focus on the action and the aesthetics. Your analysis of the movie
                is well done , and I think for a generic superhero movie such as this, you focused
                on the right details to analyze such as the actors and characters, the movie plot,
                visuals and action scenes. Sometimes you name drop characters important to the
                stories characters, such as the case for Drax but do not go into detail about it.
                Either don't name drop characters that you do not ever come up in the main story, or
                explain the motivation behind the name dropping. Ronin is a bad guy? Is he important
                to the story or the character? You made a pre-statement about the visuals in the
                aesthetics paragraph. Are we allowing that in our documentation? Although you have a
                separate opinion tag your review is essentially filled with opinions such as
                introductory "ugly personalities." Does this mean that everything up to this point
                has been an objective review. We need to revise our schema to accommodate an opinion
                tag. When you say mind blowing like Avatar under your aesthetics, I have trouble
                recalling the visuals of the movie. You should be specific when you make an
                analytical claim like that. I know that you mentioned vibrant colors but I don’t
                know if you’re referring to the vibrant colors of avatar. Also, since this is a
                marvel movie, shouldn’t you make a direct comparison with their other movies, or are
                you making this comparison for the noting a substantial difference in visual acuity?
                Lastly, I do not think this movie review needs much revision apart from some
                grammatical issues, as well as some specificity. </p>
