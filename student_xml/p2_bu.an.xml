            <intro_para> Dating back to 2009's <style type="italics">Iron Man</style>, Marvel
                Studios has had a pretty good track record with their re-branding of the classic
                marvel superheroes. They have been so successful in fact, that they re-popularized
                the idea of intertwining film continuities with 2012's <style type="italics">The
                    Avengers</style>, coining the phrase “cinematic universe” in the pop culture
                vernacular. But despite all this, Marvel took a big leap of faith with their
                experimental film, <style type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style>, a film
                based off an extremely obscure Marvel comic series. A big leap that evidently paid
                off with one of the funniest action movies of all time. <style type="italics"
                    >Guardians of the Galaxy</style> follows the story of Peter Quill, played by
                Chris Pratt, a would be treasure space pirate who was abducted from his home at a
                very young age.
                <synopsis type="plot_points">After stealing a
                particularly valuable treasure from a crypt, the infinity stone, he gets captured
                and imprisoned and forms a team of criminal mercenaries and assassins in order to
                break out and stop the fanatical space ruler Thanos, played by Lee Pace, from
                harnessing the power of the infinity stone and going on a planet-destroying frenzy.</synopsis>
            </intro_para>
            <body>
                <p>Now where the real humor and charm of the film comes into play is the cast of
                    unique and hilarious characters and interactions between them. The main team,
                    the self-proclaimed Guardians of the Galaxy, are a fantastic example of this.
                    The main cast, the so called “heroes” are no more than psychotic criminals who
                    do good out of necessity. As such, you get a lot of great moments where all
                    their ugly personalities butt heads and play off one another. </p>

                <p> Quill is an overconfident and extremely charming talker, who is ultimately good,
                    but is willing to do anything to get his way. Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, a
                    skilled female assassin who is serious and unemotional. She often plays the
                    straight man to the team's wackier characters. Drax on the other hand, played by
                    Dave Bautista, is a hyper serious warrior who seeks to avenge the death of his
                    family at the hands of Ronan. He spends most of the movie alternating between an
                    intimidating brute and comic relief as he simply does not understand hyperbole
                    or non-literal expressions. Finally you get to the duo of Rocket and Groot,
                    played by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesal respectively. Rocket is a psychotic
                    hyper-intelligent mutant raccoon who is a master engineer and weapons
                    specialist. On top of all that, he is also loud and fouled mouth, but has a
                    surprisingly touching back story. His partner in crime, Groot, is a tree-like
                    humanoid who can only says the words “I am Groot”. </p>

                <p>
                    <opinions>Just from the character descriptions, you begin to get the idea of the
                        types of situations that would play out between the extreme personalities.
                        The dialogue is witty, comedic timing is spot on, and the characters, while
                        objectively heinous, are incredibly likable. The acting in the movie is also
                        superb. Every actor seems like a perfect fit for their roles and all act
                        naturally with each other through the films. Both the dialogue and the
                        acting combined makes it seem like you are watching an actual group of
                        friends making jabs at each other and getting along despite their
                        differences.</opinions>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <aesthetics>The movie's visuals are also a sight to behold. Like the cast of
                        characters, everything is colorful. The deep space settings does not
                        discourage the movie from showing off incredibly vibrant colors and locals.
                        It is not mind blowing like <style type="italics">Avatar</style>, but it
                        certainly does not slack off. The CG animations are also top notch,
                        especially on completely animated characters like Rocket and Groot, staying
                        expressive despite all the visual effects. Finally, you got the action
                        scenes.</aesthetics>
                    <opinions>These are the only parts of the movie that I feel could be improved.
                        While not bad per say, they feel generic and kind of forced in because it is
                        a Marvel superhero movie. Their were few fight scenes that stick out and are
                        incredibly memorable for the action alone, instead its the dialogue that
                        carries it all.</opinions>
                </p>
            </body>
            <conclusion> Overall, <style type="italics">Guardians of the Galaxy</style> is a near
                spotless action-comedy blockbuster. If you love humorous characters interactions in
                incredible scenarios, then Guardians is definitely a movie you should watch. Do not
                expect any sort of deep character analysis or thought-provoking plots, instead go in
                with an open mind looking for a good, memorable laugh with characters you think were
                your own friends. I truly believe that Guardians easily takes title of the best
                Marvel movie from the second, and I am very excited for the sequel coming out next
                May. Guardians of the Galaxy, by Marvel Studios, is <summary type="rating">rated
                    PG-13</summary>. It premiered in theaters <date type="movie_premiere">August
                    1st, 2014</date>, and <summary type="gross_income">grossed $773.3 million
                    worldwide.</summary>
            </conclusion>
