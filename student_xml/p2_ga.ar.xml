            <intro_para> Teenage girls just want to hang out, be with their friends, carelessly hook
                up with boys and go to "<style type="italics">futbol</style>" matches. Adults,
                always omnipresent in their lives, are just another obstacle to overcome, in their
                path to emerge as young, independent women. The teenage girls from a remote village
                in Turkey, however, have a different approach to marriage than their adoptive family
                is used to; they want to choose whom to marry. They also want to have the freedom to
                leave their village, the freedom to an education and the freedom to act their age.
                <synopsis type="plot_points"/> The story follows a trajectory that is reminiscing of
                other, feel-good, empowering women stories, however, the storytelling is what sets
                it apart. The female perspective is strong, very personal, and follows the girls
                from carefree fun to downfall. The trouble is heavily masked in the first ten
                minutes of the film, where carefree play with their male classmates at the beach,
                turns into a shameful interrogation and demonstration of abuse from the girls'
                uncle. The cascading withdrawal from society instigated by the claustrophobic
                imprisonment of the girls because of their innocent fun, is done wonderfully by the
                    <context type="director">Turkish born French director, Deniz Gamze
                    Erg端ven</context>. <synopsis type="themes"/> The humor, sisterhood, friendship,
                and ridiculous ploys of rebellion add a warmth to a story very much about oppressive
                norms and this coming of age drama is much better for it. </intro_para>
            <body>
                <p> Quite swiftly, the caretakers of the girls, their grandmother and uncle,
                    successfully remove all "corruptions" that may affect the girls even further in
                    their preordained destiny of dutiful housewives. They begin by removing schools
                    and with it boys, "revealing" clothing, and all digital media as well as
                    attendance of <style type="italics"> futbol</style> games. The girls,
                    understandably begin to reactively push away, by cutting thigh high slits into
                    their brown, shapeless clothes, spitting in the coffee of their soon to be
                    mothers in law, or even having sex with strange boys in their uncle's car. Lale,
                    beautifully played by <context type="actor">G端nes Sensoy,</context> the youngest
                    of the five sisters emerges as the wily, most ferocious of them all, quickly
                    evoking my feelings of sympathy and warranted my encouragement of her success as
                    I watched her development. Observing her desperate plea for freedom get more
                    climactic as her sisters quickly disappeared with their new husbands, amplified
                    those feelings even more. > <context type="director"/>

                <p>
                    <aesthetics>Mustang portrays the development of the sister's home into a prison
                        after each transgression with an air of lucid dreamlike appeal. Each bout of
                        imprisonment montage is broken up by lazy, sunlight montages of the girls
                        making the best of the situation. The camera often times pans through open
                        windows and sun beams, where the girls stretch out like cats in the sun and
                        sometimes the camera follows the youngest Lale in her childplay.

                <p> Girls just want to have fun, but for these five young adults, fun has long
                    surpassed into another area into political rebellion. The village and family
                    elders view their materialism, their petty responses to their subjugation as
                    chaotic and worrying, because their fitness for marrying and being dutiful
                    wives, in their eyes, dissipates. However, there are times, when the director,
                    Deniz Gamze Erg端ven, redeems the qualities of the conservative fathers,uncles,
                    elders, aunts and mothers by removing the air of moral simplicity. He does not
                    condemn an entire society, by allowing the very same characters who have been
                    oppressors to aid in hiding some of the girl's acts of rebellion. The kindness
                    of strangers, although not bountiful, does make an appearance even when with the
                    girl's continued diminished reputation in the village. For the audience, this
                    allows the multifaceted portrayal of Turkish society, to resonate in many more
                    layers beyond simply, oppressor and oppressed. <opinions/>

            </body>
            <conclusion> The drama, perilously close to a dramatic and fatalistic end, is rescued by
                the writing of Deniz Gamze Erg端ven, who I would argue, dabbled in providing a
                resolution for the audience that fulfilled their hopes for the characters. This
                optimistic approach to the finish is not a blind answer to the dramas progression,
                but rather a message to the audience; freedom is hardly attained without the most
                awesome attempts at breaking free. <summary type="gross_income"/>
