                    <opinions type="first_impressions">Wes Anderson's 2012 film is wondrous in
                        nature and evokes a nostalgic feeling of childhood.<note type="instructor"

                <p> Moonrise Kingdom explores adventure, romance, and mysticism through a child's
                    point of view. The movie takes place in 1965 on an island called New Penzance.
                    On one side of the island resides Camp Ivanhoe and Troop 55.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">Early in the film, the least popular scout of Troop 55, Sam, goes missing.</synopsis>
                    On the other side of the island lives a young girl named Suzy who is often
                    looking through her binoculars. She is twelve years old, the same as Sam, and
                    lives with her dysfunctional family.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">She disappears as well. Shortly
                    after, we learn that the reason for the disappearance of the two is each other.</synopsis>
                    The film follows them as they traverse the island looking for a remote cove
                    using the outdoor skills Sam acquired during his time in Troop 55.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">We see Sam and Suzy have their first kiss and express what they feel is love for each other.
                    They decide that they don't like the map's name for the cove so they rename it.</synopsis>
                    Soon after, they are discovered by the island officer Captain Sharp, as well as
                    Suzy's parents and the Scout Master Ward.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">We learn that Sam is orphaned and his foster parents don't want him back.</synopsis>
                    They are separated and Captain Sharp learns that Sam will have to be taken into
                    Social Services. Sam is staying with Captain Sharp in the time being. The troop
                    sneaks Sam out and they row to a neighbor island and camp.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">There Sam and Suzy have a pseudo-marriage from a troop memberâ€™s cousin,
                        which has no legal binding, but has emotional ties.</synopsis>
                    They then begin their escape as a storm is brewing in the background. They are
                    spotted and chased as fugitives. While running, Sam is struck by lightning but
                    miraculously recovers almost instantly. The storm picks up drastically and
                    everyone including the Social Service Agent, the troop and Scout Master Ward,
                    Captain Sharp, Suzy's parents, and Sam and Suzy themselves take cover in the
                    church where Sam and Suzy first met. Sam and Suzy escape to the church steeple,
                    expecting to be separated upon capture.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">Concerned about their well-being,
                    Captain Sharp offers to take Sam in after having spent time with him earlier.</synopsis>
                    Sam agrees. Some time later we see Sam sneaking into Suzy's home in an island
                    officer uniform with a painting of the remote cove they stayed at.
                    <synopsis type="plot_points">We learn that they 
                    decided to name the cove 'Moonrise Kingdom'.<note type="peer" who="#ho.jo">I like the use of the plot points. It makes the events of the movie easier to read and understand.</note></synopsis>

                <p>
                    <context type="director">Wes Anderson</context> is popular for his unique
                    directing style. Often his films follow an almost dreamlike sequence. This movie
                    is no different and provides a strange sense of wonder that is hard to pinpoint,
                    but that viewers can attest to.<note type="instructor">does this relate in any
                        way to the content of the movie or is it purely stlistic? What elements
                        contribute to this dreamlike quality?</note> The isolated setting of an
                    island allows for a community with values and oddities of any sort, which
                    Anderson loves doing. The cast isn't an all-star cast my any means. <context
                        type="actor">Bruce Willis</context> is cast as Captain Sharp in a role that
                    almost feels out of place for the traditional action movie star, but his
                    performance is remarkable and emotional, as to be expected from such a
                    high-profile actor. <context type="actor">Bill Murray</context> is cast as
                    Suzy's father which I think works well as he can play any role where the
                    director wants a little bit of sort of cool-strangeness that comes out in any
                    character Bill Murray plays.<note type="instructor">examples of this or
                        comparisons to his other roles (especially in Wes Anderson movies)?</note>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <aesthetics>Wes Anderson employs long and shifting camera pans which helps to
                        give the movie a mystical feel. There is also an almost sepia color filter
                        over the whole movie which adds to the artistic value of the shots. There is
                        a lot of color contrast throughout the film which changes as the movie goes
                        on and the storm brews <opinions type="reaction">which I think helps the
                            viewer adjust to the mood change.</opinions> There is also constantly
                        light, fast-paced music playing in the background which smooths the
                        transitions and reminds the viewer that much of the movie is from a child's
                        point of view. There are also many intentionally silly effects such as when
                        Sam is struck by lightning and when Scout Master Ward jumps over the flood.
                        This serves to add to the dreamlike feel of the film.<note type="instructor"
                            >this is a strong paragraph</note>

            <conclusion>

                <p> Another Wes Anderson film I recently watched was <comparison type="movie"
                        >Fantastic Mr. Fox</comparison> which was released three years prior.
                    Fantastic Mr. Fox was an entirely animated film<note type="instructor"
                        >claymation, right?</note> while Moonrise Kingdom only had occasional cuts
                    to animation, however it also showed many of the artistic creativities
                    demonstrated in Moonrise Kingdom. Both films embodied the sense of dreaminess
                    and mysticism and did a wonderful job evoking a deep nostalgic wonder despite
                    the drastic difference in actual content. <opinions type="critique">One thing I
                        would have liked to have seen more in Moonrise Kingdom was character
                        background.</opinions> We know Sam is a somewhat troubled orphan but not
                    much else about his relations with his troop and Scout Master. </p>

                <p>
                    <opinions type="recommendation">The artistic value alone makes this movie worth
                        seeing. I have grown to love Wes Anderson's style as it gives me the sense
                        of wonder I was talking about more than many other movie types. I would
                        compare the sense of wonder as similar to that of Studio Ghibli movies<note
                            type="instructor">interesting comparison</note>, which I am a big fan of
                        as well. Anyone looking for a unique, mystical, nostalgia-provoking movie
                        experience should definitely give this movie a watch. </opinions><note
                        type="peer" who="#ho.jo">You could add more to the conclusion that backs up
                        what you've said before about the movie. Specifically I think it would be
                        best to reference the qualities of the movie that make it good that you
                        mentioned before, and then you could also talk about
                        aesthetics/actors/comparisons to other movies.</note>
                </p>

                <p> Moonrise Kingdom had an estimated budget of 16 million dollars, and grossed
                        <summary type="gross_income">a little over 45 and a half million</summary>,
                    making it quite successful. It premiered in the United States on <date
                        type="movie_premiere">May 25th</date> and collected almost 523,000 dollars
                    during its opening weekend. </p>

            <p>The draft is reviewing the Wes Anderson film Moonrise Kingdom. The plot is explained,
                the film is analyzed in the context of the director and main actors, the aesthetics
                of the movie are reviewed, and it is compared to another film, Fantastic Mr. Fox.
                The plot is explained very well, and my only complaint is that I think you could add
                one or two sentences at the beginning to explain the background behind the setting
                or the characters. (Later you did mention that there wasnâ€™t much background
                information given on the characters, but at least a short description of what is
                known about them will help). The next paragraph refers to the director, Wes
                Anderson, and the actors. I like the referencing of Wes Anderson throughout the
                review because it adds perspective and it also seems more credible when you can
                compare this movie with his other work. I think analyzing specific plot points or
                events of the movie is a good idea, because most of your analysis is in the form of
                comparisons or more general statements about the film. More of a defined statement
                can be made in the conclusion, because I donâ€™t think it reinforces the rest of the
                review as well as it could. Overall I think what you wrote was very strong, and you
                mostly need to add more opinions/reactions/analysis relating to the synopsis, modify
                the conclusion to address your previous paragraphs and claims you made, and to
                smooth out the beginning of the synopsis. </p>

            <p>This is a solid review. You have an appropriate level of detail throughout, I
                especially like your aesthetics paragraph, as it really helps establish your earlier
                claim of dreamlike/nostalgia, etc. One potential critique/question I had was whether
                or not you wanted to reveal the entire plot at the outset, given that some readers
                might be trying to decide whether to watch the movie, and maybe don't want to know
                when the kids are discovered, or whatever. Just a thought.</p>
