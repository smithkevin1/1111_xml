                Mistry pondering as to why he didn't come up with a new Tata Indica</image>
            <p>
                <location>Tata Group Headqauter's</location>Tata Indica is a supermini car produced
                by Tata Motors (who are a part of Tata Group, which is a multinational conglomerate
                holding company, headquartered in India). The Indica is India’s first indigenously
                developed passenger car in 1998 and was unveiled by Ratan Tata (ex, now interim,
                chairman of Tata Group). </p>
            <p>During his time as CEO, Ratan Tata had made great endeavours to promote the Indica as
                the best reasonable priced hatchback for the common man. In fact, Tata motors were
                so focused on reinventing the Indica that they forgot about producing and launching
                different cars like every other sane automobile company would do. For 17 years, they
                kept on remaking and relaunching the Tata Indica with new names like Indica V1,
                Indica V2, Vista V2 etc. However, things changed when Cyrus Mistry didn’t bother
                upgrading the Indica which has been the status symbol for the Tatas since years.
                Cyrus turned a blind-eye towards the company’s rich heritage of remaking the Indica
                and that is why the board decided to bring back the experienced ex-chairman Ratan
                Tata on board.</p>
            <p>Rumours are surfacing that Ratan Tata’s first big project is to design a new and
                exciting model of the Indica, which will help recall the value of the Tata brand and
                get their customer’s excited once again.</p>
            <p>For now, it is ‘Tata’ for Cyrus Mistry!</p>
