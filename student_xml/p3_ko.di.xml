                Mistry pondering as to why he didn't come up with a new Tata Indica</image>
            <p>
                <location>Tata Group Headqauter's</location>Tata Indica is a supermini car produced
                by Tata Motors (who are a part of Tata Group, which is a multinational conglomerate
                holding company, headquartered in India). The Indica is India’s first indigenously
                developed passenger car in 1998 and was unveiled by Ratan Tata (ex, now interim,
                chairman of Tata Group). </p>
            <p>During his time as CEO, Ratan Tata had made great endeavours to promote the Indica as
                the best reasonable priced hatchback for the common man. In fact, Tata motors were
                so focused on reinventing the Indica that for 17 years, they kept on remaking and
                relaunching the Tata Indica with new names like Indica V1, Indica V2, Vista V2
                    etc.<note type="peer">I feel as though many others car companies have been doing
                    this as well.</note> However, things changed when Cyrus Mistry was elected as
                the new CEO of Tata Group.<note type="peer">Who is Cyrus Mistry?</note> He did not
                bother upgrading the Indica line-up which has been the status symbol for the Tatas
                since years.<note type="peer">Since I don't know who Cyrus is, I also don't
                    understand why this is a big deal.</note> Instead, he turned a blind-eye towards
                the company’s rich heritage of remaking the Indica and that is why the board decided
                to bring back the experienced ex-chairman Ratan Tata on board.<note type="peer">I
                    personally think you jumped ahead of yourself a little bit here. I know you
                    mentioned Ratan was an ex-Chairman, but you never told us that Cyrus was the new
                    chairman which makes the whole last part of this paragraph weird to read for
                    anyone who has no prior understanding of what is going on.</note></p>
            <p>Rumours are surfacing that Ratan Tata’s first big project is to design a new and
                exciting model of the Indica, which will help regain market value for Tata Motors
                and get their customer’s excited once again.</p>
            <p>For now, it is ‘Tata’ for Cyrus Mistry! <note type="peer">Clever pun here. I like how
                    you built up to it.</note></p>

            <p>This satirical news article is about the company Tata Motors and their car brand, the
                Tata Indica. The article goes into great detail about the history of the Tata Indica
                and Tata Motors’ ex-CEO, Ratan Tata. The article details how the current CEO, Cyrus
                Mistry has failed to reinvent the Indica, as is tradition for the company and so the
                former CEO will be brought on to replace him. Overall, I think this is a good
                satirical article but it is meant for a niche audience. As someone who is not keen
                on the automotive industry, I was confused with information with the article. Some
                key explanatory details, such as Cyrus Mistry being the current CEO of Tata Motors
                were left out, meaning the audience was expected to know who he was before reading
                the article. Also, it is a little confusing as to what parts of the report are real
                or made-up. Of course some of the jokes within the article made it clear when it was
                being serious or not, but I feel as though all the actual background on the subject
                matter clashes with the article’s silly nature. Overall this made it particularly
                hard for an outsider to understand the article’s main joke, but after some
                researching I understand it now. Finally, I believe the article’s title should
                undergo some revision. The title is often times the most important part of the
                genre, and while yours would actually be fine for a real news article, as a
                satirical news article it is not very eye-catching. Try incorporating a part of the
                joke into the title that would make a reader want to read it. Like I said, however,
                I think this would be a fine article for a niche audience to get a laugh at if they
                had prior knowledge of the subject matter.</p>
