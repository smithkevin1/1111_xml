        <intro> Climate change has been a pressing issue coming into the 2000s, with numerous local
            and global efforts taken to reduce the catastrophic effects of this problem. The Obama
            Administration has taken several steps in the right direction to reduce our dependency
            on non-renewable resources which can definitely benefit our planet in the long
                run.<opinion type="main"> However, Donald Trump’s surprise win means that the
                climate change budget may be reduced dramatically. How will this affect America's
                stance on climate change over the coming years? </opinion></intro>

        <body_para> Let’s start by discussing the praised efforts of the Obama Administration with
            regards to combating the devastating potential effects of climate change. Obama’s two
            main energy acts, the Clean Energy and the Recovery Act, both include <citation>
                creating new "clean energy" jobs and technologies, making America more energy
                independent, and reducing carbon emissions (whitehouse.gov) </citation>. <evidence
                type="statistics">In 2009, over $80 billion in clean energy investments were
                provided by the Clean Energy and Recovery Act.</evidence> These investments were
            mainly in renewable energy, funding local energy projects and training people for green
            jobs. <citation> Additionally, carbon tax on industry was increased to ensure fewer
                pollutants (CNS News) </citation> Although the benefits of the act aren’t always
            noticeable, the fact that non-renewable resources are conserved is a definite plus for
            the environment. </body_para>

            the steps that are currently being taken to make America more environmentally friendly.
            Our President-elect Donald Trump believes that climate change is a “hoax” and plans to
            withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, <citation> a plan ratified by 112
                countries aimed at keeping the global average temperature from increasing by 2
                degrees Celsius (The Verge) </citation>. Trump tweeted earlier “The concept
            of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing
            less competitive” (Twitter). In an interview by CNS News, Trump claimed that this was a
            joke, however, this quote does speak to the public in a different way. Hundreds of
            thousands of US jobs are centered around manufacturing, and if energy policy persists,
            there is the possibility of those currently employed to lose their jobs.
                <citation>Furthermore, more than 85% of energy is from non-renewable sources– a
                change in energy composition will decrease industry revenue as well.

        <conclusion>America currently emits 15% of global CO2 emissions, and having Trump as

                Trump wants the same jobs in the manufacturing industry to be kept as they are (NY
                Times)</citation> because he believes that, with an increase in renewable energy
            usage, there will be greater job loss for certain people. So what impact will this
            disregard to climate change by the Trump Administration have for America? Only time will
            tell. Our best bet to make America great again is to bank won Trump’s changing
            views.</conclusion>

        <report type="peer" who="mi.as">
            <p>First of all, you made a few statements without any cited sources. At this point,
                what we know about Trump and climate concerns are all talk. Even so, where are your
                sources for this statement, "Donald Trump’s surprise win means that climate change
                funding will be reduced dramatically." You need something to back up that claim.
                Like a quote from Trump or one of his associates. You can definitely get some quotes
                from Trump saying he will lax the energy emissions laws, etc. Also you cannot source
                Wikipedia! Even though it will almost always be accurate and have some good basic
                info, it is sill not an acceptable source to pull from. But, if you look at the
                sources that were cited in that article, you can definitely use those.</p>

            <p>You mentioned how Trump said his tweets was a joke. I think you should really expand
                on the idea that Trump was able to mobilize all these people by saying what they
                would want to hear, and then going back on those claims once he was elected. I think
                there is a lot to talk about in terms of him playing to people's angers, an dhow
                damaging that can become, especially with an issue as pressing and dire as climate
                change. Overall, you have a solid piece with a relevant and interesting topic. Just
                do some more research and find more sophisticated sources. Maybe look at some
                opinions pieces on the same topic, and check out the info they looked at and used.
