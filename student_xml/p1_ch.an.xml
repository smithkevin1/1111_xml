            <intro>
                <p>Much of what has been discussed within this class so far largely concerns rather serious genres. The choice of a song from a childrenâ€™s show was, then, an attempt to break down something that would have a bit more levity to it. However, Here Comes a Thought, written and composed by Rebecca Sugar, is rather unusual, and, despite my original intentions, rather serious in its purpose. It is a song that furthers the story, as well as character development, much like every other song produced for the show. Yet, it is also an effort to indirectly teach the audience a method to focus on the present and by doing so, attempt to work through their own feelings of guilt and regret over the past.</p>
