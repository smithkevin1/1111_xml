            <intro>
                <p>Much of what has been discussed within this class so far largely concerns rather
                    serious genres. The choice of a song from a children’s show was, then, an
                    attempt to break down something that I assumed would have a bit more levity to
                    it. However, Here Comes a Thought <note type="instructor">quotes around song
                        titles</note>, written and composed by Rebecca Sugar, surprised me in the
                    fact that, despite my initial thoughts, it is rather serious in its purpose. It
                    is a song that furthers the story, as well as character development, much like
                    every other song produced for shows. Yet, it is also an effort to teach the
                    audience something that can be very helpful to people of all ages.<note
                        type="instructor">need much more info/context about the scene and situation
                        here. Who is the author? Why did they write the song? What is the video you
                        end up talking about? What scene does the video participate in? Who is the
                        audience for the song? For the video?</note></p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>Between the episode’s<note type="instructor">episode of what?</note> name,
                Mindful Education <note type="instructor">quotes around video titles</note>, as well
                as the lyrics of the song, urging the listener to “take a moment and find
                    yourself”<note type="instructor">citation should follow this quote</note>, the
                mentor figure of the series, Garnet, is seen teaching the technique of mindfulness,
                sometimes known as mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness, according to UC Berkeley,
                deals with acceptance through having <citation>“our thoughts tune into what we’re
                    sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the
                    future”</citation><note type="instructor">should be a q element followed by a
                    citation element</note>. This segment is designed to show that these techniques
                can help<note type="instructor">can help what?</note>. Through this, for the first
                time in the episode, the young girl, Connie begins to accept and acknowledge her own
                emotions concerning her accidental injury of another student. The glowing
                butterflies within the scene, the thoughts, burst out of her bag as if through their
                own will. Although she has attempted to bottle up these emotions since the beginning
                of the episode, she is once again forced to relive her own memories and guilt. It is
                with Garnet’s reminder to, once again, “take a moment and ask yourself if this is
                how we fall apart”, as well as her own use of the repeated mantra “but it’s
                    not”<note type="instructor">citation needed</note>, that she begins to calm down
                and accept her own remorse over what happened, allowing herself to cry. Only after
                this strong moment of catharsis do the swarming, troubling thoughts blow away,
                signifying that taking the time to calmly examine your own thoughts can allow you to
                step back from the edge of panic and stop yourself from overreacting. This segment
                visually draws people in and, for older members of the audience perhaps, asks them
                to revisit their own similar experiences and reconsider how they handled it. For
                all, however, this teaches a very valuable life lesson regardless of whether the
                audience uses or does not use the specific techniques associated with mindfulness
                meditation.</bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>This message is further brought home to the audience through the way in which
                it is told. Through the first half of the song, Ruby and Sapphire, who physically
                and mentally combine to form the mentor, Garnet, are shown struggling with their own
                troubled thoughts and emotions. While those problems remain vague and aren’t shown,
                it lends credibility to the practice of mindfulness by demonstrating that it is
                something that a cherished and respected authority figure also uses. By
                demonstrating that these characters have managed to find greater peace with
                themselves and their past actions through mindfulness meditation, the episode very
                openly seems to suggest that it is something that the audience sitting at home could
                try, even if the technique wasn’t blatantly, specifically mentioned. By
                demonstrating the method and displaying it in a very positive light, the show
                attempts to convince others to do this themselves likely much more effectively than
                it would have had mindfulness meditation only been mentioned by name.</bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>Despite this show, Steven Universe<note type="instructor">what is
                this?</note>, being primarily geared towards kids, it has a large following of all
                ages and is well known for exploring important themes, with the creator herself
                stating in an interview that she’d <citation>“really like to talk about identity and
                    individuality, and self love”</citation>. As a result, people of all ages and
                demographics are invited to partake of the show itself and the messages it provides.
                However, what’s unusual about this specific show, which extends into some of its
                other songs, is that it while everyone is invited to watch and take part, it
                specifically seeks to include LGBTQ children and members of the audience, something
                that, frankly, could be considered rather revolutionary in the world of children’s
                television.</bodyPara>
            <concl>
                <p>Although I initially made the assumption that songs from kid’s shows would mostly
                    be lighthearted and educational, this particular song, in addition to a few of
                    the others from the same show demonstrate that the two don’t necessarily go hand
                    in hand. Additionally, this specific show at least, defied another of my
                    expectations. Rather than strictly focus on the one audience you’d expect a
                    kids’ show to focus on, namely, children, it eagerly welcomes people outside of
                    the traditional audience for kids shows<note type="instructor">OK, but this info
                        should be way sooner. Is this the claim you are making?</note>. Given that I
                    don’t watch that many shows that kid’s shows however, it is hard for to say
                    whether this is the norm or not within the genre.</p>
