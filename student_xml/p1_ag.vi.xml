            <intro>
                <p>The discourse community is made up of individuals or groups like bloggers,
                    readers, the audience, fashion design students and designers that are interested in
                    the subject. The common goal is to share their love and passion in the industry of
                    fashion. Fortunately, the specific genre of Question and Answer fulfills this roll
                    by taking the ideas expressed in the designs to a written text. This particular
                    genre can fulfill he niche of being an informative resource to the discourse
                    community. However, due to the exclusiveness of who may participate in this genre,
                    it cannot be as an open communication. The exclusiveness of the genre stems from the
                    fact that designers are protective of their designs, ideas and inspirations so they
                    only wish to interface with official interviewers. Often at times each question and
                    answer will only reach a specific portion of the discourse community because of the
                    place that they are published.</p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>For example, the Question and Answer with Kiel James Patrick was published on
                a website tailored towards men’s interest. Hence, the members of the community that
                would end up accessing the article are young men. While fashion is the true
                expression of the designer’s voice that can transcend language barriers, the written
                contexts of the industry remains the Question and Answer, press releasing. The goal
                that this gene fills is to support the discourse community by producing ideas to
                common consumers. Question and Answer represents an efficient way to transfer these
                ideas to a lot of people in a short amount of time and space. The Question and
                Answer genre not only flexible and unique but also an efficient model that can
                spread information to a wide range of consumers of the discourse communities. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>Bold, vibrant, and glamorous are three words that come to mind when describing
                a fashion magazine. The term Vogue and Elle are a staple in every fashionistas
                vocabulary, but what are the differences between the two magazines? They are both
                are synonym of fashion in every detail. Although the similarities are quite obvious,
                the differences are arduous to observe. Elle is still known as the worlds best
                selling fashion magazine, despite the staggering age difference between the two.
                Vogue pitches its articles to an older audience, while Elle is accessible to a wider
                range of age groups. Of course, if you are a true fashionistas or at least an
                aspiring one, you will buy Vogue. The editors of these fashion magazines are trying
                to introduce their target audience to the beauty of the world that fashion has to
                offer. They do this by using big catchy titles, lots of bright pictures, and famous
                celebrities that will hook the reader and reel them in. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>When creating a fashion magazine the editors are trying to appeal to a certain
                target audience. Each style of writing and topic has an audience that they are
                attempting to connect with. They use phrases and words that their readers can relate
                to. Fashion magazines have a very broad range of readers that they are trying to
                reach. Each fashion magazine strives to get the attention of a certain. Depending on
                the desired audience the magazine will cater its image to appeal to them. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>One creates a fashion magazine with the intention to introduce new and up
                coming trends to their customers. In order to keep up with the trending world of
                fashion these editors must constantly be doing research. They fly across the world
                to see different cultures and designers and try to incorporate their style or
                combine it with two different cultures. Editors of fashion magazines must make sure
                they are always ahead of the curve. </bodyPara>

            <concl> <p>Once the editor has collected his or her data they must begin assembling the
                magazine in a way that will engage their customers. Their goal is to introduce their
                customers to the fashions all around the world, new trends, and classics. Fashion
                magazines aren’t trying to sell its audience everything in its magazine. Instead the
                editor is attempting to open the minds of its customers and expose them to new
                ideas. Some pieces in the magazine the customer may fall in love with, while others
                they wouldn’t be caught dead in. The editor typically writes a biased review of the
                clothes with maybe a little bit of their own opinion. The idea is not for them to
                make up the readers mind on the clothes but simply introduce the consumer to it. A
                fashion magazine is a mode that provides their customers an actual glimpse of what
                they are looking to purchase and how to best introduce them to the latest exciting
                styles that the fashion world has to offer. To help them do this they use colors,
                and article titles that would appeal to their customers, choosing products that will
                expand the style of their target audience.</p>
