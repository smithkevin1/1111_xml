        <intro>
            <opinion type="main">I have always believed that test scores should not determine the
                fate of a person.</opinion> Maybe I should not be complaining because my grades have
            always been “up to standards.” Yet I do not believe test scores should define where a
            person is going to end up in life. Standardized tests are the only tool used to measure
            the level of intelligence of a person and the failing of a standardized test can
            undermine future success. Brilliant minds are denied the opportunity of becoming the
            people that will one day cure cancer or the ones that will build our future simply
            because they were never great test takers. People have amazing hidden abilities that
            cannot be completely determined by a standardized test. </intro>
        <body_para>Test scores should not decide the fate of a person. It is unlikely that the
            greatest minds- Einstein, Freud, Wundt, Floy Washburn- had to take a standardized test
            to prove to people that they indeed had great minds. </body_para>
        <body_para>No one is known for how great they did on that math exam that they took when they
            were a freshman in high school, nor are they known for how well they performed on their
            AP exam. I do not want to be known for how great my high school transcript looked nor
            for how well my SAT scores were. I want to be known for becoming a great listener after
            I had no one that was willing to listen to me. I want to be known for overcoming my
            struggles and for how strong a person I have become because of them. I want to be known
            for my resilience and my ability to overcome difficulties. A person with an SAT score of
            1410 could have all the determination in life to become the greatest engineer as that of
            a person that got a score of 1720. A simple number that is calculated by the standards
            of a group of people should not determine the school a great mind ends up
            attending.</body_para>
        <conclusion>I have found myself in situations that have determined who I am today, but who I
            think I am is viewed very different by those who receive my test scores. People are
            taught that life is all about getting up once you fall down. Life is as simple as an
            abstract idea. Our whole lives we are told to strive for great things and to dream big
            so that one day our dreams will come true. Yet, all of this simplicity is shattered by
            the idea that everyone is measured by the same standards. A monkey can climb a tree, but
            a fish never will. Everyone is different, but when going into college we are all
            measured the same way, without taking into consideration that some of us are fishes and
            some cannot climb trees.</conclusion>

            <p>This is a very interesting op ed. It talks about how standardized tests are inherently 
                flawed due to the fact that they only measure test taking skills. People are all different 
                and while some may not be good at taking tests, that does not mean that they are not 
                smart. There is not very much that I can think of to critique about this op ed. It is 
                very opinionated, as an op ed should be because it is in the name of the genre. It goes 
                over the opinion that standardized tests should not be used to determine people’s intelligence 
                fairly well. One thing I would say though is that a replacement for standardized tests 
                should be discussed. If standardized tests do not work, than what would be a better option? 
                Is there a better way to easily determine if someone is intelligent? Another thing is that 
                you could use more evidence to support your opinion. You point out that intelligent people 
                of the past did not take standardized tests, but what are some examples of people today that 
                did poorly on tests yet still were ultimately successful in life? The rest of the op ed is 
                really good and there is not much else that I can critique. There is a lack of the tags we 
                came up with in the schema, but that is very easy to just quickly add in to where they fit. 
                Otherwise, just perhaps bring up a possible replacement for standardized testing and put in 
                some more evidence to support your opinion.</p>
