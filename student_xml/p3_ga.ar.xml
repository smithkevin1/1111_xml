            <p>
                <location>New York City, New York</location> Early Monday morning, at Trump Hotel,
                our newly elected president is preparing a speech for one of the most holiest of
                holidays in the United States. A local corresponder managed to get Mr. Trump on the
                phone for a short interview to discuss what the think tank Mr. Trump works with, has
                come up for Thanksgiving. Coming after the much talked about cabinet proceedings,
                Mr. Trump is on the hotseat for what seems to be ill-recieved choices in
                representation. At dissent at an all time high, this holiday couln't have come at a
                better time for Mr. Trump. This is a time for respect, appreciation of what we are
                given, and a time to celebrate what unites us as American. However, Thanksgvinging
                is also a time to pardon some Turkeys, as is tradition in typical White House
                fashion. When asked about his plans in the upcoming Thanksgiving where he will
                reside as President, Mr. Trump stated was quoted saying, "Well, it's going to be
                great. Its going to be better than before. We are going to have the best turkeys.
                Only the biggest turkeys, they will be huge. The turkeys I pardon will be
                huge."<quote/>
