                <location>New York City, New York</location> Early Monday morning, at Trump Hotel,
                our newly elected president is preparing a speech for one of the most holiest of
                holidays in the United States. A local corresponder managed to get Mr. Trump on the
                phone for a short interview to discuss what the think tank Mr. Trump works with, has
                come up for Thanksgiving. Coming after the much talked about cabinet proceedings,
                Mr. Trump is on the hotseat for what seems to be ill-recieved choices in
                representation. At dissent at an all time high, this holiday couldn't have come at a
                better time for Mr. Trump. This is a time for respect, appreciation of what we are
                given, and a time to celebrate what unites us as American. However, Thanksgvinging
                is also a time to pardon some Turkeys, as is tradition in typical White House
                fashion. When asked about his plans in the upcoming Thanksgiving where he will
                reside as President, Mr. Trump stated was quoted saying, "Well, it's going to be
                great. It's going to be better than before. We are going to have the best turkeys.
                Only the biggest turkeys, they will be huge. The turkeys I pardon will be
                huge."<quote/>

            <p>I believe you do a good job conveying this specific genre. Your article and your
                situation as a whole can have someone confused about whether or not this is real;
                had me wondering, which is really what satire is really about. This whole idea about
                the phone interview fascinates me; I see it as an awesome creativity. The added
                quote is even better since it is something he would say which can drive your
                audience to think that this is fact happened. Your diction is great which makes this
                piece of satire even better. Although your writing is vnot extended, I can see the
                humor and the critic which is what this genre uptakes, not sure if it was your
                desired uptake. I do not think there is anything that I would change about your
                writing. I would just say adding a little more to your writing would make this more
                interesting since you make the reader want to know more about this situation but
                then cut them short in ending with the quote. Although this is supposed to be
                constructive criticism, there is nothing I could point out that reflects poorly on
                your writing, on the contrary it gave me ideas on how to improve my own rhetorical
                situation and the way I convey my genre as a whole. </p>
