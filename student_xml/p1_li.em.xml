            <intro>General Mills created Lucky Charms in 1964 as the perfect children's cereal:
                “toasted oats” for a healthful breakfast with marshmallow “charms” to appeal to a
                child’s taste buds <citation>(General Mills)</citation>. Today, their targeted consumers have
                flip-flopped-- or better worded, they are still the same consumers, who are now
                adults. Lucky Charm’s targeted consumers have two roles: one as parents of young
                children, and the other as sentimental adults who remember the joy of eating the
                sugary cereal. <mainArgument/>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara/><bodyPara> Lucky charms are aimed at adults: as parents, but more importantly
                consumers. Lucky charms uptakes as a sentimental piece of childhood for adults to
                enjoy again. To begin with, the cereal’s outward appearance looks mostly unchanged
                from the original box. There is still the bright red color of the box and the large
                yellow Lucky Charms logo. Lucky the Leprechaun is still overtaken with joy as he
                presents his charms and a rainbow. This unwavering appearance will immediately take
                an adult back to pouring cereal out of the same box as a kid. The appearance is
                hence, uptaken positively, and hopefully enough to make a former consumer a current
                consumer, as it may drive those to ‘relive’ a positive experience.</bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>If adults are not moved to buy Lucky Charms for themselves, then they are
                buying for their children. Lucky charms have managed to still be relevant in a
                health-crazed 2016 through the use of buzzwords on every panel of the cereal box. To
                stay on trend with food in America today, Lucky Charms happily announce that the
                cereal is gluten free <citation>(Luckycharms.com)</citation>. They changed the way they process the
                cereal so no gluten gets mixed in, just to be able to label their cereal as
                pseudo-healthy. Gluten has become an attention-grabbing label for food products,
                that has somehow been automatically been associated with ‘healthy.’ Of course, there
                are people, such as Celiac Disease sufferers (1% of the population), who
                legitimately cannot consume gluten, but many Americans have fallen victim to
                marketing glamorizing being <q>“gluten-free.”</q> Furthermore, whole grains are another
                idolized phrase in the food industry. Lucky Charms assures parents that the cereal
                has <q>“11 grams of whole grains per serving”</q> <citation>(Lucky Charms)</citation>. Even though there is 10
                grams of sugar per ¾ of a cup, which is about half the total daily sugar allowance
                for an eight year old child <citation>(Family Education)</citation>. These words create a smoke screen
                which allow parents to believe, whether they truly do or not, that Lucky Charms are
                not as unhealthy as common sense would lead one to believe. This allows parents to
                feel better about allowing their children to eat the cereal, and for them to maybe
                grab a bowl as well. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara> Finally, Lucky Charms aims to cast parents in the role of a responsible
                consumer, which would make them feel good about purchasing Lucky Charms. On one side
                panel of the cereal box, General Mills outlines all the ways it is benefiting the
                world. General Mills, the company that produces Lucky Charms, says they are
                “committed to sustainably source 100% of our cereal boxes by 2020.” As nice as this
                sounds, it is quite vague, and they offer no further reading on the topic. They also
                printed on the back that they are “giving back” through the Box Tops for Education™.
                Again, this sounds nice and wholesome, and it is. However, everything from office
                supplies to frozen meals also participate in this program, making it an industry
                norm, not setting General Mills apart. The most deceptive part of the cereal box is
                where they tote that Lucky Charms has 10 grams of sugar per serving, as if that is
                healthy. As mentioned before, 10 grams of sugar is almost half the allotment for
                kids aged 2-18 <citation>(American Heart Association)</citation>. And, most kids (or adults) will eat
                more than the ¾ cup serving size. These true yet deceptive claims made on the side
                of the cereal box are not to fill up space, they are to convince consumers (parents)
                that buying Lucky Charms is a good choice not only for the health of you and your
                child, but also for the environment.</bodyPara>
            <concl>The genre of Lucky Charms is a cereal that is being targeted at adults-- but not
            parents, adult consumers. A cereal as explicitly unhealthy as Lucky Charms, it is still
            relevant in a health crazed 2016 America because General Mills has focussed on eliciting
            wholesome and sentimental feelings from adults to drive sales.</concl>
