            <p>This draft was a resume that would likely be used to apply for a job in a computer science setting. Personally, I really think you should get rid of the section in the beginning that talks about studying computer science at Northeastern. There are other ways of showing that you are a student, such as saying "I am a student who wants to gain more practical knowledge..." and etc. The way it is now, it feels unnecessary in an objectives statement, and also makes it feel ling and somewhat clunky. Additionally, it is about your education, so the part about studying computer science can probably be put there, with a note that you'll expect to have that degree by 2020.I suggested that you add more detials about the apps you worked on mostly because I think it'll give a better sense of your experience. You may or may not want to add headers for the sub-categories of qualifications for the sake of clarity and organization. It all sort of flows together at the moment if you just check the formatted version of your resume. In terms of language and tone, your job summary points are nice and concise, although since you only have one job listed, I think you can afford to go into a little more detail like I've previously stated. Since you state that your goal is specifically to "gain more practical knowledge and contribute in a team of software or mobile application developers", you could maybe highlight any previous group work experience in your previous job if you can. That might make you look like a better candidate.</p>
