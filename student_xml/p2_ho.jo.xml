            <p>This is a decent start, but check my inline comments for areas where the language can
                be improved (jb_summary section). Based on your use of the schema here, I'm not sure
                you fully understood your group's design (see notes above for specific instances).
                The main issue is the lack of headers and single job_summary element make the format
                of the rendered version difficult to read, an important aspect of the resume genre
                is ease of quick reading and clear demarcation of information. I could also imagine
                having more "additional information" since your other experience is limited--clubs?
                software experience? Etc.</p>
