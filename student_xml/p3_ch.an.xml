    <intro>
        This election has been an utter dumpster fire. It's old news now, that Trump is our assumed president-elect. But the immediate fallout was intense for me. I had friends dissappear for a day, only to come back and tell me they were desperate to get their name changes on paper before January. My girlfriend called, deeply unhappy and distressed, and I'll be honest, my first thoughts were about how she would take the news, followed immediately by "Oh my god. I have to walk right back into the closet. This is, across the nation, a literal step backwards." Even my father, a man I knew, growing up, as a staunch, down the ticket Republican, confided in me that this election <quote>"made him ashamed to call himself a Republican"</quote> and that he planned to switch his party affiliation afterwards. Many, across the liberal and moderate spectrum, have called for an abolishment or revision of our current electoral system. Raging debates about the Electoral Collage aside, it is likely that the minorities of the U.S. will have to endure at least four years of a presidency with a man who has proven, through words and action, time and again, that he holds absolutely no respect and regard for their lives. And it's not just minorities, the disabled, LGBTQ+ citizens and their families. Anyone concerned for the environment, or the state of the U.S.'s international affairs is right to be worried about this presidency.<opinion type="main">That being said, Trump alone, were he surrounded by competent, level-headed individuals, would be bad, but bearable. Trump with the likely unstable cabinet of his choosing? A disaster.</opinion>

        <opinion type="opposing">Most people might say to relax, that most of this is up in the air, that he hasn't even made set-in-stone, official choices yet for his entire cabinet.</opinion> But his prospective choices already say a lot about his administration. <example>For example, just looking at the New York Times' list of Trump's likely picks is alarming. One of his possible choices for Secretary of Defense, James N. Mattis reveals, at the very least, a disturbing disregard for the temperaments and attitudes of his cabinet. <evidence type="other">According to CNN, Mattis, while speaking at a panel, stated, in reference to the people of Afghanistan, specifically the men, that <quote>"You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them."</quote></evidence> Flippant remark or not, that casual disregard for the lives and humanity of others isn't something pleasant to see in a man being considered for the role of Secretary of Defense.</example> <evidence type="other">According to the New York Times, another prospective Secretary of Defense candidate is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. This man, when asked about voting against $300 million in federal funding for the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, responded that he "fully support[s] Children's Hospital" despite voting against every bill supporting funding for the hospital that had a chance to succeed.</evidence> The consideration of this man for Secretary of Defense shows a complete disregard for <opinion type="opposing">Donald's campaign promises to chase corruption and dishonesty out of Washington, a major reason why many people decided to vote for him.</opinion>. However, what he'd be doing here, is walking up to the dishonest politicians, the very people many of his own supporters dislike, and handing them even greater power.</evidence>

        What's just as bad is Trump's choice of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, a position that is close to the president and is meant to be a fair spokesperson for national policy options to the president. However, this is a man who completely seriously tweeted <example><quote>"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others"</quote> with a link to a video claiming, both in its audio and description, that <quote>"Fearing Islam which wants 80% of humanity Enslaved or EXTERMINATED is totally RATIONAL and hence cannot possibly be called a Phobia"</quote>. How can such a dangerously misinformed man possibly be expected to endorse policies that are fair and consider the wellbeing of all American citizens, regardless of religion?</example>
    </body_para>    
    <conclusion>But this is what we get with the blind leading the blind. Frankly, the prospect of Trump handing out these powerful and influential positions, which have the power to shape policies with generations long impacts, is terrifying. There's a huge buzz about Trump likely seating one, if not four new Supreme Court Justices already. With Trump, the threat might not be him. It might be the people he hands power over to on a silver platter. And while we, the people, may not have a large say in who he appoints to his cabinet, we do get a say in who is appointed to Congress. So if you, like me and many others, worry about a Trump presidency and his cabinet, then please come out and vote in 2018 for House and Senate seats.</conclusion>
