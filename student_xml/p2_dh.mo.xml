            <p>The genre of the above paper is resume. From the looks of it the resume seems to be
                for a business oriented industry. You have written your resume very well. You have
                covered all the aspects that were enlisted in the schema document and have tried to
                make the resume look professional. However, there are some problems. Your
                qualification paragraph isn’t formatted properly. There are bullet points in between
                the paragraphs which makes it look untidy. Furthermore, there isn’t a header for the
                Education paragraph. Also there is a blank pointer between your education paragraph
                and what I think is supposed to be additional information. You do not have an
                Additional Information tag which makes the resume looks unprofessional. On the other
                hand, your resume is written in a very formal tone and has good use of vocabulary.
                The structure of the resume in terms of listing the different elements in a
                particular order is spot on. You’ve a ton of good points. Your objective paragraph
                is very descriptive and informative. Lastly your work experience has all the
                necessary information like duration and job summary included in it. One thing I
                advise you to focus on is formatting the resume. Once you rectify the formatting
                error, your resume will look much more professional. Nevertheless, I think you’ve a
                pretty strong resume and have done a fairly good job of representing yourself </p>
