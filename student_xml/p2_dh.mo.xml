            <p>You have written your resume very well. You have covered all the aspects that were
                enlisted in the schema document and have tried to make the resume look professional.
                However, there are some problems. Your qualification paragraph isn’t formatted
                properly. There are bullet points in between the paragraphs which makes it look
                untidy. Furthermore, there isn’t a header for the Education paragraph. Also there is
                a blank pointer between your education paragraph and what I think is supposed to be
                additional information. You do not have an Additional Information tag which makes
                the resume looks unprofessional. On the other hand, your resume is written in a very
                formal tone and has good use of vocabulary. The structure of the resume in terms of
                listing the different elements in a particular order is spot on. You’ve a ton of
                good points. Your objective paragraph is very descriptive and informative. Lastly
                your work experience has all the necessary information like duration and job summary
                included in it. One thing I advise you to focus on is formatting the resume. Once
                you rectify the formatting error, your resume will look much more professional.
                Nevertheless, I think you’ve a pretty strong resume and have done a fairly good job
                of representing yourself </p>
