            <intro>
                <p>“Fargo” opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, meeting with two crooks at a bar 
                    in Fargo, North Dakota. He plans to have the men kidnap his wife so he can split the ransom 
                    money with them from his wealthy father-in-law. The movie then continues with an amazing telling 
                    of how everything went wrong with Lundegaards plan and the Minnesota police chief Marge Gunderson, 
                    played by Frances McDormand, who investigates what is going on when three people are killed.</p>
            </intro>
            <body>
                <p>The best part about the movie is the characters. All the actors did an amazing job in portraying their 
                    character. Each character is believable and life-like. William H. Macy especially did a great job 
                    with the character of Jerry Lundegaard. It is easy to see the distress he is under from his plan falling
                    apart and how he still believes he can somehow pull it off even with absolutely nothing going his way. 
                    You see how much trouble he really has dealing with all his problems, especially when he fails to call off 
                    the kidnapping when he realizes he might not need it. </p>
                <p>The character of Marge Gunderson, the police chief investigating the murders that followed the kidnapping, 
                    is another excellent character. As the star of the movie, she portrays the “Minnesota nice” stereotype, being 
                    friendly towards everyone she meets including those she interrogates and arrests. It was great watching her 
                    intelligently piece together the case slowly up to the climax of the film.</p>
                <p>The two men who kidnap Lundegaard’s wife were also great characters. Specifically Carl, who was played by Steve Buscemi. 
                    His character brings a good amount of humor into the film even with the dark plotline. His horrible attempt to deal 
                    with a state trooper, his conversations with his partner, and his overall ineptness work together to make him a great 
                    character. Everytime witnesses refer to him, they are only able to say that he was a “funny-looking guy”.</p>
                <p>Even small characters in the movie where great. They really helped make the world of the film feel alive. Marge’s husband 
                    had a painting contest he was in where he was trying to get one of his paintings on a stamp. He was also a sweet dude and 
                    it seemed like they had a great marriage. He wakes up early with her just to make her breakfast. Other characters with even 
                    fewer lines were amazing, and every character had accents and said lines such as “Yah, you betcha”. The characters all 
                    worked together to make the movie come to life, like this story really could have happened in some small towns and suburbs in Minnesota.</p>
                <p>The movie also looked fantastic. There were no confusing shots and you could see everything of importance in each one. 
                    Some wide shots were especially beautiful, such as when Marge finally confronts the kidnappers on a frozen lake. The 
                    soundtrack also fit the movie perfectly. Each song went great with the scene it played in, although there were no standout 
                    memorable songs. Most just added to the scene to they were in to make it even better.</p>
            </body>
            <conclusion>
                <p>Overall, “Fargo” was a fantastic film. It told a story realistically and did not try to answer every question, leaving some
                   things open ended just like they are in real life. The characters were amazing and realistic and really made the entire movie.</p>
