        <intro>London, United Kingdom: London has always been considered one of the world’s
            most prestigious fashion capitals in the world. But as the reality of Brexit sets
            in, <opinion type="main">what does it mean for the British Fashion industry, and what will the long and
                short term effects be?</opinion></intro>
        
        <body_para><bg_info>On June 26th, 2016, <situation>Britain made history when they voted to leave the European
            Union.</situation></bg_info> With many feeling shocked and surprised at the result, the effects were immediately
            felt worldwide, with <evidence type="statistics">over $2.1 trillion dollars in stock value lost globally in the
            24 hours after the vote. The pound is now at a 7-year low against the dollar</evidence>, as the
            nation’s currency depreciated significantly, and worries that this could severely impact
            the bottom line, with many companies outsourcing to semi-peripheral countries such as
            China (where they are paid in dollars) were realised. A weaker pound has forced
            international brands to raise their U.K. prices, and though <opinion type="opposing">this means that retail
            has now become slightly cheaper for tourists</opinion>, it also means that it is more expensive
            if you are a resident in Britain.</body_para>
        
            <body_para>It is estimated that <evidence type="statistics"> 90% of the British Fashion Council voted for the Remain campaign,
            with fashion icons such as Christopher Bailey, CCO of Burberry, Alexandra Shulman,
            Editor-in-chief of Vogue, and designers such as Anya Hindmarch and Vivienne Westwood</evidence>
            supporting the opposition of Brexit. For many reasons such as manufacturing, exporting
            and staffing, many expect fashion to be hit hard in the next few years, as the industry
            relies so much on the fluid movement of trade and people across borders, especially in
            Europe, with Paris and Milan being especially important relations. The EU’s open borders
            have made it easy for many companies such as <example>Céline (based in Paris) to run operations
            on both sides of the channel, but a leave vote means that they will have to re-evaluate
            their decision to establish creative departments in London.</example></body_para>
        
            <body_para>Though many prominent fashion figures were disappointed with the vote, London Fashion
            week continued on without a hitch, and as the un-official kick-off to the much anticipated
            shows, London-based designers, <situation>editors and executives were invited for an evening at
            10 Downing Street</situation>, where new prime minister Theresa May has just moved in. Natalie Massenet,
            founder of Net-A-Porter spoke eloquently, and an important remark she made was:
            <quote>“We are living through a remarkable transition. But also in an age of extraordinary
            innovation.”</quote> Guests reported that May did not speak directly about Brexit at the event,
            but that she was very supportive of the industry and the significance of fashion’s
            contribution to the economy.</body_para>
        
            <body_para>A concern at the forefront of the industry is the looming restrictions on global borders,
            and what that will mean for <situation>fashion education</situation>. London hosts many of the most highly
            accredited institutes to study fashion, and they rely on a diverse set of students coming
            in every year, who are multi-cultural and multi-lingual. The industry relies on the outsourcing
            of talent, and many designers we see on the runway today studied in London.
            This has always been an important part of fashion, and many are worried that we may decrease
            in diversity following our exit from the EU. Fabio Piras, the Fashion Course Director at
            Central St. Martins, commented: <quote>"I cannot deny that it is worrying to think that we will
            probably see a decline in graduates’ employability in the EU. I am equally concerned with
            the potentially decreasing numbers of EU students [applying to CSM], as they will not be
            able to come as freely as they can now.”</quote></body_para>
        
        
            <conclusion>Looking forward to early next year, when the now-famous Article 50 clause will supposedly
            be activated, the fashion industry’s hope is that we close trade negotiations as soon
            as possible, with minimal impact to property regulations and visas. I don’t think we have any
            idea what the biggest challenges are, that we will face in the wake of Brexit, and many
            are worried that we will experience another, greater, financial crisis similar to that of
            2008.  The key here is to not get ahead of ourselves, keep a cool head and urge politicians
            to handle negotiations with the EU as peacefully as possible. It has become clear that
            there will no re-referendum, so we are stuck in this position for the foreseeable future,
            and can only make the best of it, and come out the other side with the best regulations we
            can agree on, and not become isolated, but use it as an opportunity to better ourselves
            as a country.</conclusion>
