            <intro>
                <p>A lot of people use many genres when it comes to communicate their dissagremet
                    with those who make the decisions for the public. Many of there genres can
                    include advocacy, letters, newspaper articles, etc. One particular genre that
                    comes to be very broad is <genre>protest</genre>. <argument type="main"
                        >Throughout our history we have seen people uptake the genre of protest and
                        the most interesting part is that there is never the same outcome since not
                        every event plays out the same exact way every time around.This makes this
                        genre very complex when looked from a greater point of view<note
                            type="instructor">okay, this is close, but you need to be more specific
                            with your argument: how is it complex? what parts of that complexity
                            should we be paying attention to? what do you mean by "a greater point
                            of view?"</note>.</argument>
                    <scene>One particular event that can be looked at when it comes to this genre is
                        the series protest that occured throughout the district of the Boston Public
                            Schools<note type="instructor">why should we look at this specific scene
                            versus other examples of protest?</note></scene>. These protest were
                    held by students and parents throughout the city who refused to accept the
                    reforms that the city was trying to bring up to the system. Each and every
                    protest leading to a different outcome<note type="instructor">this is a fragment
                        and lacking punctuation. </note>
                </p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>The new plan to cut the budget from the Boston Public Schools system sparked
                different concern in students, parents and teachers;<note type="instructor">just a
                    comma here</note>since this meant that student's education could be affected as
                well as job<note type="instructor">what do you mean by "as well as job?"</note>
                among other projects. The matter was taken into students' hands<note
                    type="instructor">inset comma</note> who quickly came up with ways to
                communicate their concerns with this new system that was bound to affect the lives
                of those whose education depends on the public system. What exactly makes students
                take up this genre of protest to convey the message they are trying to deliver?
                    <note type="peer" who="#ko.di"> Is the last sentence a question?</note>. As we
                have seen before, throughout the history of this country people have found that
                protest can lead to people understanding that the voices of the underdog are indeed
                important. What exactly makes protest this element that people decide to uptake and
                create different outcomes depending on the type of situation they see themselves and
                those around them.<note type="instructor">hat do you mean by this?</note> People
                have simply seen that protest can lead to answered questions and action.<note
                    type="peer" who="ko.di"> The last sentence seems a little unclear to me. Could
                    you elaborate or refine it a little?</note>
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara><evidence>“We are the future of this country,” one student speaker said. “How
                    dare they take away our education when they want us to be well-rounded
                    students.”</evidence><note type="instructor">citation?</note> was stated by a
                student in an article that was published proceeding the protest. Students, like this
                one, found themselves concerned about not only their education, but the country as a
                whole, which is why people decided that protest would be the one way to address the
                issues. Protest<note type="instructor">protests</note> are the one thing that are
                not foreseen<note type="instructor">what do you mean? people never see a protest
                    coming? Are you sure this is accurate?</note> by the media and those in power,
                which makes this genre useful. But what exactly makes protest a complex genre when
                it comes to this specific issue is different situations that play out relatively
                    different<note type="instructor">differently</note> every time around. How can
                people use this genre if there is no way of predicting what exactly will happen when
                people use protest to express their concern to the public.<note type="instructor"
                    >this reads like a question--a good one, though</note>
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>This genre, just like other genres, becomes more complex in the aspect of
                analyzing, simply because the genres shift into new genres in a given situation<note
                    type="instructor">right, this is uptake--the genre gets taken up in different
                    ways, often in ways that the protestors don't want</note>. <note
                    type="instructor">For example, a...</note>Example being, a protest could shift
                to a whole new genre which is violence. Now, this is what it is meant when we talk
                about genres being complex. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>Going back to the particular protest that occurred in Boston due to the budget
                cut in the education system, different genres arose; public hearings among others
                    <note type="peer" who="#ko.di"> Could you possibly show evidence of the public
                    hearing?</note><note type="instructor">I agree with your peer reviewer, some
                    evidence of the different ways that the protest was taken up by different groups
                    of people would be helpful</note>. The most important part about this issue is
                how this genre of protest becomes so important in this particular situation and in
                other situations in general. People, in this case students, needed to find a
                particular action that could lead to the change of the situation that was in play.
                This is why, not only this genre but many others become very important. Since they
                help people when it comes to a given situation.<note type="instructor">okay, but
                    stay with the specific example you are analyzing</note>
            </bodyPara>
            <concl>
                <p>In a lot of cases, people use different types of genre to approach their given
                    situation. Since students in the Boston Public School system saw that there was
                    a new decision being brought forward that they had to change, they understood
                    that this genre made the most sense. And even though they could not exactly
                    predict what outcomes this genre would bring up, it still confirmed the fact
                    that using genres do not bring out the same outcome since situations are not
                    played the same way when people look at it. It also depends on the perspective
                    that it is being looked at from and how people decide to uptake this genre. In
                    this particular event, people analyzed previous situations when this genre was
                    put in play, and they went for it. With the understanding that new genres could
                    possibly also come up. </p>

        <report type="peer" who="ko.di">
            <p> In the above genre analysis paper, Jhadley is talking about how students, parents
                and teachers used protest as a genre to voice their opinions on the new plan to cut
                the budget from the Boston Public Schools. In my opinion, you do a very thorough job
                in describing the genre and how it is related to your topic. You give a very brief
                yet proper explanation of the situation in which the genre, protest, is being used
                by the students which helps the reader thoroughly understand your paper. I feel you
                should add a couple more evidences to solidify your argument. You could perhaps take
                a small quote which describes how the budget cut would affect the management of the
                publics schools. This would add a different standpoint in your paper which would
                help the readers’ asses the gratitude of this situation much better. Also you could,
                if you want, elaborate the motif behind the government cutting down the budget from
                Boston Public Schools. This would add another element to your paper which you could
                somehow interlink with your main genre. Overall I find your paper very fascinating.
                I feel like you have covered all the assessment criteria. A couple of sentence need
                to be reframed! </p>

            <p>This is a fascinating topic, and I think your insights are very well thought out and
                important. However, here are a few issues that are maing your analysis less
                compelling than it could be. 1) Argument: Needs to be more specific. As I read it,
                your claim is that by examining the protests around the BPS reforms we see that,
                though protests may respond to the same/similar rhetorical situations, the uptakes
                of this genre are very unstable; we can see this through the complex and varied
                outcomes of the protests. 2) Specificity/detail: you often lose sight of the BPS
                protests that should be at the center of this essay; instead, you fall back into
                generalizations about protests as a whole. These generalizations are difficult to
                support without specific and detailed evidence from the example you are analyzing.
                3) Precision of language: spend some time making sure that your sentences are
                specific and clear--see moments I mention in the text above for examples of places
                where your sentence construction is obstructing your meaning.</p>
