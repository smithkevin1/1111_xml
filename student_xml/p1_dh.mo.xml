            <intro>
                <p>The Volkswagen Beetle is a two door production car that was made from 1938 to
                    2003. With approximately 20 million produced, the beetle is the longest-running
                    and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made. Under Adolf Hitler’s
                    orders, the car was designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who would later create the
                    Porsche brand of automobiles a few years later. Considered by many to be the
                    most influential car of our time, this essay attempts to be a brief
                    representation of the historical, cultural and economical changes that made the
                    Volkswagen Beetle achieve its status of “the peoples car”. </p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara/>Historically, this car is important not because of its age or its popularity,
            but because of the purpose it was created for. Circa Germany in early 1930s. Germany was
            devastated after the first world war, and the great depression in 1930 was the last nail
            in the coffin. Unemployment was high, and the economy was in shambles. It is important
            to note that Hitler did not have complete power in the early 1930s, so he wanted to
            prove to the German people that he wanted to make Germany great again by revamping the
            economy. So In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a
            ‘Volkswagen’, which literally meant peoples car. The beetle included a lot of Hitlers
            unusual whims. For example the Beetle is airtight and can briefly float, and he wanted a
            powerful engine (40 hp was considered powerful at the time) that was very fuel efficient
            - revealing his unrealistic expectations from the car. <bodyPara/>
            <bodyPara>However, Porsche managed to build the car and by 1938 the car was off the
                assembly line. What was the purpose? Hitler intended to boost the German economy by
                starting projects like the Beetle, so that he could create millions of jobs in the
                manufacturing industry. He intended to reverse Germany’s poor economy by creating
                infrastructure projects which would require a lot of labour (hence jobs), machinery
                and resources. And for Hitler, his plan worked. He used Kairos to perfectly time his
                project. If he proposed the idea at a different time the people would not have
                supported him. The car sold in the millions and gave Germany the economic stability
                it needed. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>Culturally, the car is an icon. In the 1960s, the Beetle was famously
                associated with the hippie movement and surf culture. Because of its unique design
                and low price, it was truly a car for the masses. Hippies often did aesthetic
                customizations to their Type Is and IIs and psychedelically painted ones were early
                examples of art cars.However, it was also a social statement, for those who could
                afford it in third world nations. For example in India, the Beetle was seen as a
                luxury vehicle, but in the U.S. it was seen as a symbol of German practicality over
                American decadence. This presented an interesting rhetorical situation. In the
                Indian context the car was seen as a representation of wealth, but in the global
                market it was seen as a cultural and artistic icon. It reflected the situation of
                the time. It featured in movies, paintings, music and other forms of media.
