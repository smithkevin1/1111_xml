                    <genre>The textbook genre</genre> is a well-known, largely permanent and exists
                    as a sole entity itself, as well as one of the central backbones of college
                    education. Genres are defined by their scenes and the underlying experiences
                    that we as individuals attribute to them and expect from them <citation>(Devitt,
                        Reiff and Bawarshi)</citation>. The college education scene employs <note

                        example of the genre?</note>
                    <genre>the textbook genre</genre> as a response to the need of a condensed body

                    <note type="instructor">off</note> The development of this genre in the past 30
                    years has been consistent in some aspects of its trajectory from the 1980's
                    until current day. <note type="instructor">any evidence for this claim?</note>
                    <note type="instructor">okay, I'll buy that</note>
                    <argument type="supporting">An analysis of two examples of the textbook genre,
                        taken from two different time periods, 1980s and 2008, reveal that they
                        supplement science differently in the textbook. The way they supplement or
                        reduce narrative in the genre showed the genre adapted to the rapid growth
                        of information. In more recent textbooks the authors have presented more
                        condensed and practical information in response to that growth, as opposed
                        to narrative. The ease at which the genre can be adapted to suit the time
                        periods material and information, allows this genre to persist in modern
                        education.</argument>
                    <argument type="main"> Both examples of the genre are intended for
                        undergraduates to understand the subject, and both encourage the readers to
                        interact with the genre in the learning process via mathematical problems.
                        This reveals that this genre has existed as a response to rheotrical
                        situations for so long, because learning practical sciene topics require
                        interaction with practice problems this genre usually presents. Also,
                        legitemacy is maintained because of the reputation of the authors and their
                        presenting of sources used to make arguments. This legitemacy trumps other
                        primary sources of information that may be found online, and allows this
                        genre to persist as a response to the need for a condensed body of knowledge
                        in education.</argument>

                    <note type="instructor">it</note>
                    <note type="instructor">I agree with your peer reviewer here, I'm having trouble
                        following your argument; perhaps this is because you use words like "might"
                        and "could." Try to be assertive and specific here, "An analysis of two
                        examples of the textbook genre, one from the 1980s and one from today,
                        reveal __________" something like that would make more sense as a main
                        argument.</note>
                    <note type="peer">Which claim is your main argument? You might want to focus on
                        just one, and use the other as a supporting argument.</note>

            </intro>
            <bodyPara>
                <context>Cosmology, The Science of The Universe by Edward Harrison is an
                    introductory cosmology textbook published in the 1980s, a time where science was
                    beginning to compound exponentially upwards.</context> Steven Weinberg, the
                author of ,"Cosmology" had his book published the year of 2008, intended for an
                audience that had been exposed to the glamours of space exploration.<note
                    type="instructor">something is missing here</note> The intended audience in 2008
                were the <participants>students</participants> of physics, whom were already
                presently acquainted with the developments of the modern world in physics and
                cosmology while the older counterparts in the 1980's still had a substantial part of
                the universe in a fog of uncertainty. The 1980's students would be the pioneers in
                cosmology and the study of the universe. <evidence>The sentiment is expressed in the
                    preface of the 2008 textbook where Steven Weinberg attributes the establishment
                    of the science of elementary phyiscs in the year 1980, which was also the date
                    of the publication of Dr. Harrison's textbook <citation>(Weinberg
                        p.vi)</citation>. This pattern of acknowledgment of the year 1980 as a time
                    of rapid growth in the field reveals that authors can modify a textbook to
                    better reflect the time period in which they are writing. The author is
                    conscious of the infancy or maturation of the material and can easily adapt the
                    genre to it. This maleability makes it possible for this genre to survive in
                    modern education.</evidence>
                <note type="peer">You may want to explain who the original intended audience was and
                    why an American outlook is so different.</note></bodyPara>

            <bodyPara>The modern, most recent view of the genre of textbook is that of a body of
                knowledge written for the consumption of an <participants>educator</participants> or
                a <participants>student</participants>, whom both are expected to read the books.
                The knowledge is expected to be introduced in higher and higher degrees of
                competency since a science book builds on the knowledge previously written. A
                general physics book such as these two Cosmology books both, regardless of time
                period interact with mathematical problems and expect the student to practice
                mathematical problems. <evidence>It is self evident that the 2008 textbook on
                    Cosmology took a mathematics heavy approach starting as early as page 2, <q>The
                        coordinate transformations that leave this invariant are here simply
                        ordinary three-dimensional rotations and translation</q>
                    <citation>(Weinberg)</citation>. Weinberg writes the textbook with little room
                    for discussion or illustrations such as the 1980 book by Dr. Witten.</evidence>
                <note type="instructor">something missing here?</note> The 1980's book written by
                Dr. Witten, apart from the mathematics, focused on the creative thought that
                inspired the study of space, with fantastical images spanning the entire history of
                human experience, as seen in the illustrations that dot the pages and the quotes
                that begin the chapters; <evidence><q>"He has ventured far beyond the flaming
                        ramparts of the world and in mind and spirit traversed the boundless
                        universe- Lucretiues (99-55 B.C.)"</q></evidence>
                <citation>(Harrison)</citation>. The presence of quotes, of depictions of early
                cosmology reveal a reflection of the 1980's as a time of rapid growth in Cosmology,
                and the book serves to both inspire and teach. The lack of quotes and illustrations
                in Dr. Weinberg's textbook show the effect of science at its peak density, as
                opposed to the early onset. Regardless of the presentation of information, both
                books employ problem sets and mathematics in order to teach key sceintifc concept of
                physics. The consistent mathematical problems that appear decades apart reveal that
                not much has changed in the way this genre responds to the teaching of important
                concepts. In both books, practice is emphasized as a tool to teach the mathematics
                that interact with the science of the universe. <note type="instructor">why do you
                    say that?</note>
                <note type="instructor">okay, but how specifically does that follow from the
                    evidence presented above (math vs. curiosity)?</note><note type="peer">I think
                    this this is a fantastic claim with which you can write an entire paper on. Try
                    and explore this a little more.</note>
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>The education genre in the northeast, during the 80's was that of unbridled
                imagination urged on by the space race, and the content of this textbook is set to
                inspire confidence in the young entering freshmen about the beauty of space. In 2008
                however, with cosmology becoming more theoretical and less inspired by novelty, the
                textbook reflected the dramatic shift in the genre of space and how to present it.
                This reveals that when textbooks, the genre in question, interact with
                ever-expanding science, textbooks tend to lose their ability to read as a novel, and
                more as a technical manual. Weinberg, even ackgnowladges the burden of too much
                information and states, <evidence><q>So much has happened in cosmology since the
                        1960s that this book necessarily bears little resemblance,</q> to his
                    earlier books <citation>(Weinberg p.vii)</citation>. </evidence>This shift in
                science is mirrored in the genre, and we can conlude that the genre has been adapted
                with the times, and thus stayed relevant as a source of educational information<note
                    type="instructor">I agree, another example here would go a long way</note><note
                    type="peer">Try throwing in some specific examples from each book to demonstrate
                    your point. It will help the reader understand what exactly you mean by "took a
                    mathematics heavy approach" versus "discussion or hypothetical". In text
                    citations are also required on the project assesment.</note></bodyPara>

            <bodyPara> Finally, having discussed how two different cosmology books present the study
                of cosmology, the next logical jump would be to discuss why the textbook genre
                existed then and continues to exist now. The purpose of the textbook has not changed
                since the three decades of publishing in between them. The <scene>academic
                    scene</scene> still requires textbooks as the primary method of teaching. One of
                these reasons is that the condensation of knowledge is universally regarded as the
                best means of transmitting information. Books usually have physical material that
                they quote from in regards to their knowledge, and this is what a<participants>
                    student</participants> or <participants>educator</participants> can expect from
                a <genre>textbook</genre>, knowing that the knowledge is sound. For example
                "Cosmology" contains references at the bottom of the page of information <evidence>
                    <citation>(Weinberg 30)</citation> or at the end of the chapter (Harrison
                    68).</evidence> The authority that textbooks provide as primary sources is one
                of the strengths of using this genre as a response to the need for a condensed body
                of knowledge. Teaching using websites such as Wikipedia, which reference linked
                sources, still do not uphold the agency that professors who write textbooks do. A
                reason for this stems from the argument presented above, about the unchanging nature
                of education in a scientific field requiring practicing math problems, that both
                books promote even 30 years apart, while simultainously synthesizing information.
                    <note type="instructor">I'm not sure I totally understand the claim here.
                    Certainly, I'm having trouble seeing how the evidence you presented (or your
                    analysis of it) leads the reader to this claim.</note>
                <note type="peer">It feels like you are making a lot of claims about text books as
                    an idustry, but not a lot of evidence ot back it up. You should use the
                    differences you found in your analysis to explain how the text book genre has
                    changed over time to better support your main argument.</note><note type="peer"
                    >You are very light on xml tags over all. I'd suggest taking the time and
                    matching up some of the vocab you used with the element list and tagging
                    them.</note>
            </bodyPara>


            <concl>
                <p>In conclusion, the <participants>student</participants> plays the part in the
                    academic scene, by interacting in a set pattern with a <genre>textbook</genre>.
                    In the cosmology textbooks listed above, the role the
                        <participants>student</participants> assumes is that of a blank slate, <note
                        type="peer">Give a quick definition of that term in case someone doesn't
                        know what it is.</note> and its up to the way their previous experiences
                    with <genre>textbooks</genre> to synthesize the material. This genre, the
                    textbook, even when examples are seperated by decades, not much changes in the
                    way that it presents science to the reader. It has matured to represent the
                    growing body of science, but the fundemntal practice of science remains
                    consistent. The <participants>student</participants> can open a textbook and
                    find a blend of culture and science or just science without narrative if the
                    information is dense. In either case, the author of a textbook of science
                    understands the primary goal of teaching, and the role a textbook takes up in
                    that role. The authenticity as a primary source makes this genre response in
                    science education more prevalent than online sources of information, and has
                    contributed to the stability and consistency of this genre in education. <note

        <report type="peer" who="#bu.an">
            <p>This essay is a genre analysis of the text book genre, which specifically refers to
                two different cosmology text books from two very different periods of time. As such,
                the main argument is that due to their differences in publication dates, they have
                very different styles despite containing the same material and appealing to the same
                audience. Personally, I felt the language and prose used was very well done, and
                many of the vocab terms we have studied were used very well. The problems start to
                arise however, when referring to the essays main argument, and the evidence
                supporting it. It feels as though from the thesis statement, that there are two main
                claims being made, but it really feels like only one is being addressed throughout
                the piece. Take another look at the main claim and try to refocus it a little so
                that the reader can understand what you’ll be talking about. Similarly, I’d supply a
                little more direct evidence from the two text books to support your claim. There are
                no in text citations (Which is one of the requirements on the assessment criteria)
                and a few claims made in the last body paragraph with little evidence. The analysis
                you did do was well done, I just thought it could be weaved into your argument a
                little better. “Different universities may favor different books based on university
                prestige, that is, a book written by the universities professor, creates the scene
                and uptake of believing that the education from that professor is superior to the
                education received by a professor using an unaffiliated book.” While I completely
                agree with you, statements like this one don’t have anything to back them up in your
                paper. You might want to cut it and refocus some of your body paragraphs to really
                hone in on your main claim. </p>

        <report type="instructor" who="#smi.ke">
            <p>There is a lot going well here. I like that you pay close attention to many aspects
                of the textbooks, from the layout and format down to the specific use of language. I
                think the main difficulty here is that I have trouble following your main argument
                (i.e. it reads less like an argument and more like a speculative statement). This
                affects understanding through your body paragraphs (especially the first one), since
                it is hard to see exactly what you are driving at. I think your peer review partner
                made a lot of solid suggestions (especially in in-tex comments) that I don't see you
                taking up in your final draft. Finally, your sub-claims sometimes lack evidence; or,
                rather, it is unclear how the evidence you present specifcially leads to the claims
                you make in the body paragraphs. If you consider revising, one option would be to
                cut down on the scope of the essay and pay attention to one specific feature and how
                looking at that feature in these two examples can reveal something about the
                shifting academic scene (whether that is an argument about how participants w/in
                that scene are addressed, or what they expect).</p>

                    <item>Address one (or more) of the questions posed on the prompt: I see where
                        you are driving at some of these, particularly around the roles for
                        participants (readers, writers) of a genre</item>
                    <item>Contain a clearly stated main argument: see my notes above </item>
                    <item>Emphasize evidence in support of claims (textual evidence or otherwise):
                        see notes above </item>
                    <item>Use a few of the terms from the vocabulary list: certainly uses terms and
                        I think uses them correctly to analyze the context and formal features of
                        the examples </item>
                    <item>Provide an overview of genre broadly (beyond an individual text): yes </item>
                    <item>Be detailed and focused: sometimes was difficult to follow (I think maybe
                        due to the breadth of claims you're trying to make) </item>
                    <item>Contain citations (in-text and works cited): okay</item>
                    <item>Be structured as an essay: make sure you review your essay before
                        submitting, there were several examples of unfinished sentences, etc. (and a
