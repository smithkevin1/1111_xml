            <intro><p> The textbook genre is a well-known, largely tolerated and divisive genre that
                exist perpetually as an entity in itself as well as thematic element in college
                education. Genre is defined by scenes and the underlying experiences that we, as
                individuals attribute and expect from an element such as a textbook. However, genres
                feed of each other just like memories feed of each other to create patterns that
                allow us to experience intelligence. The textbook is a genre that stems from the
                college, pedagogical, educational genres that interplay to give it its meanings. The
                current, most widely accepted view of the textbook among college students is that of
                the necessary evil. The method of updating textbooks to maintain a no resale value
                and increase demand for widely similar bodies of knowledge is what drives the
                divisive force behind the ill received understanding of textbooks. <argument type="main">The
                    modern cosmology book as compared to a book from the 1980's might be different
                    in it's way that treats the reader, and the genres that surround itself. Most
                    textbook writers are conscious of their audience, and use different genres to
                    reach the reader. </argument>
                <note type="peer">Which claim is your main argument? You might want to focus on just
                    one, and use the other as a supporting argument.</note>
                <note type="peer">Also take another look at your xml tags. There are a lot of errors
                    that can be fixed pretty quickly.</note></p></intro>
            <bodyPara> Cosmology, The Science of The Universe by Edward Harrison is an introductory
                cosmology textbook published 1980, a time where science was beginning to compound
                exponentially upwards. Steven Weinberg, the author of Cosmology was published in
                2008 in a continent that would take up the genre of textbook very differently from
                the readers of the United States. However, since the point of reference is now 2016
                from a student studying in America, from a climate where the genre of textbook is
                uptaken differently from what the authors first imagined, some error will be
                introduced. <note type="peer">You may want to explain who the original intended
                    audience was and why an American outlook is so different.</note> The modern,
                most recent view of the genre of textbook is that of a body of knowledge written for
                the consumption of an educator or student, whom both are expected to read with
                similar efficiencies. The knowledge is expected to be introduced in higher and
                higher degrees of competency since the book builds on the knowledge previously
                written. A textbook carries with it the idea of homework, the genre of note-taking
                and the genre of educational quizzing and testing. This epicenter of modern
                education should be presented differently in these two books, since the time periods
                are vastly different. Focusing on the presentation of the book itself, the covers
                offer little color, except for the streak of the color spectrum on the 2008 book.
                Both black, suggest to the reader the emptiness and blackness of space. However the
                1980 book, also has within it a circular patterns resembling galaxies suggest a fill
                of space. Both play to the era's interested educators and students. This could
                suggest that the expectation of the 80's, a time of fantastic breakthroughs in Space
                Travel were vastly concerned with the possibilities and would have been taken as
                possibilities, where the science saturated era of 2008 would have been most focused
                with the limits and understandings of science. Both eras are contributing to the
                authors understandings of their textbook genre and the expectation of the audience
                differs in that regard. </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>It is self evident that the 2008 textbook on Cosmology took a mathematics
                heavy approach with little room for discussion or hypothetical such as the 1980 book
                by Dr. Witten. Taking The 1980's book also focused on the creative thought that
                inspired the study of space, with fantastical images spanning the entire history of
                human timespan as seen in the illustrations that dot the pages. <note type="peer">I
                    think this this is a fantastic claim with which you can write an entire paper
                    on. Try and explore this a little more.</note> The education genre in the
                northeast, during the 80's was that of unbridled imagination urged on by the space
                race, and the content of this textbook is set to inspire confidence in the young
                entering freshmen about the beauty of space. In 2008 however, with cosmology
                becoming more theoretical and less inspired by novelty, the textbook reflected the
                dramatic shift in the genre of space and how to present it.<note type="peer">Try
                    throwing in some specific examples from each book to demonstrate your point. It
                    will help the reader understand what exactly you mean by "took a mathematics
                    heavy approach" versus "discussion or hypothetical". In text citations are also
                    required on the project assesment.</note></bodyPara>
            <bodyPara> Finally, having discussed how two different cosmology books present the study
                of cosmology, the next logical jump would be to discuss why the textbook genre
                existed then and continues to exist now. Finding no fault with the arithmetic
                knowledge presented in both books, the knowledge is deemed necessary. Both authors
                picked different means to teach an undergraduate student, but one author wrote the
                book during a time where textbooks were the only medium of transmitting information.
                Why did the author from the 2008 book "Cosmology" openly choose to transmit his
                knowledge in the form of a textbook, and why transmit the knowledge at all, when
                openly sourced cosmological mathematics exists online. The genre of college
                education carries within it the sub-genre of textbooks. It exists solely because the
                university genre is inseparable from the unifying symbol; textbook. The language in
                the textbook is also unifying, and a "college level" reading level exists for this
                purpose. The complexity increases, doubly so, when there are often times different
                books for the same subject matter at a specific undergraduate level. This redundancy
                also affects the way different departments in the universities set each other apart
                from one another. That is, textbooks are a genre, that are used as a tool of
                identity in the undergraduate curriculum. Different universities may favor different
                books based on university prestige, that is, a book written by the universities
                professor, creates the scene and uptake of believing that the education from that
                professor is superior to the education received by a professor using an unaffiliated
                    book.<note type="peer">It feels like you are making a lot of claims about text
                    books as an idustry, but not a lot of evidence ot back it up. You should use the
                    differences you found in your analysis to explain how the text book genre has
                    changed over time to better support your main argument.</note><note type="peer"
                    >You are very light on xml tags over all. I'd suggest taking the time and
                    matching up some of the vocab you used with the element list and tagging
                    them.</note>
            </bodyPara>

            <concl>
                <p>In conclusion, the student plays the part in the academic scene, by interacting
                    in a set pattern with a textbook. In the cosmology textbooks listed above, the
                    role the student assumes is that of a "tabula rasa" <note type="peer">Give a
                        quick definition of that term in case someone doesn't know what it
                        is.</note> and its up to the way their previous experiences with textbooks
                    to synthesize the material. Depending on what textbook a student open, the
                    expected way of approach will be governed by the student's experiences with the
                    humanities and the sciences. Cosmology, The Science of the Universe, takes the
                    responsibility to present the material so that students do not have to assume a
                    role based on their expectations of the material. That, I believe is an art lost
                    in translation, 28 years in the future.</p>

            <p>This essay is a genre analysis of the text book genre, which specifically refers to
                two different cosmology text books from two very different periods of time. As such,
                the main argument is that due to their differences in publication dates, they have
                very different styles despite containing the same material and appealing to the same
                audience. Personally, I felt the language and prose used was very well done, and
                many of the vocab terms we have studied were used very well. The problems start to
                arise however, when referring to the essays main argument, and the evidence
                supporting it. It feels as though from the thesis statement, that there are two main
                claims being made, but it really feels like only one is being addressed throughout
                the piece. Take another look at the main claim and try to refocus it a little so
                that the reader can understand what you’ll be talking about. Similarly, I’d supply a
                little more direct evidence from the two text books to support your claim. There are
                no in text citations (Which is one of the requirements on the assessment criteria)
                and a few claims made in the last body paragraph with little evidence. The analysis
                you did do was well done, I just thought it could be weaved into your argument a
                little better. “Different universities may favor different books based on university
                prestige, that is, a book written by the universities professor, creates the scene
                and uptake of believing that the education from that professor is superior to the
                education received by a professor using an unaffiliated book.” While I completely
                agree with you, statements like this one don’t have anything to back them up in your
                paper. You might want to cut it and refocus some of your body paragraphs to really
                hone in on your main claim. </p>
