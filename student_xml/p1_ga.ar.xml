            <intro> The textbook genre is a well-known, largely tolerated and divisive genre that exist perpetually as an entity in itself as well as thematic element in college education. 
                Genre is defined by scenes and the underlying experiences that we, as individuals attribute and expect from an element such as a textbook. However, genres feed of each other just like memories
                feed of each other to create patterns that allow us to experience intelligence. The textbook is a genre that stems from the college, pedagogical, educational genres that interplay to give it its meanings.
                The current, most widely accepted view of the textbook among college students is that of the necessary evil. The method of updating textbooks to maintain a no resale value and increase demand for widely similar 
                bodies of knowledge is what drives the divisive force behind the ill received understanding of textbooks.  
                <mainArgument>The modern cosmology book as compared to a book from the 1980's might be different in it's way that treats the reader, and the genres that surround itself. Most textbook writers are conscious 
                of their audience, and use different genres to reach the reader. </mainArgument>

                Cosmology, The Science of The Universe by Edward Harrison is an introductory cosmology textbook published 1980, a time where science was beginning to compound exponentially upwards. Steven Weinberg, the author of 
                Cosmology was published in 2008 in a continent that would take up the genre of textbook very differently from the readers of the United States. However, since the point of reference is now 2016 from a student studying 
                in America, from a climate where the genre of textbook is uptaken differently from what the authors first imagined, some error will be introduced. The modern, most recent view of the genre of textbook is that of a body
                of knowledge written for the consumption of an educator or student, whom both are expected to read with similar efficiencies. The knowledge is expected to be introduced in higher and higher degrees of competency since 
                the book builds on the knowledge previously written. A textbook carries with it the idea of homework, the genre of note-taking and the genre of educational quizzing and testing. This epicenter of modern education
                should be presented differently in these two books, since the time periods are vastly different. 
                    Focusing on the presentation of the book itself,
