                <p><situation>A book review serves primarily as an informational resource, an
                        assessment and description of a work of fiction or non-fiction.<note
                            type="instructor">wouldn't this be a genre tag?</note></situation> Janet
                    Maslin begins her review of <citation source="#Book">“A Little Life”</citation>
                    by giving a general overview of the book she will be discussing, with details
                    such as when the book was published, size of the novel, her first impressions,
                    most noteably she writes: <q>"It’s a big, emotional, trauma-packed read with a
                        voluptuous prose style that wavers between the exquisite and the
                        overdone.</q>" <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT
                        2015)</citation> She also mentions that the book is shortlisted for a prize.
                    Her introductory paragraph is almost a review within the actual review itself,
                    as it gives a quick overview of the book’s timeline, and a brief description of
                    her thoughts and first impressions.<note type="peer" who="#to.fr"> What is your
                        main argument?</note></p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara><argument type="main">This particular genre of book reviews exists to help
                    potential readers decide whether they want to read the book
                    themselves.</argument><note type="instructor">I would expect your main argument
                    to appear in your introduction and for your body paragraphs to contain
                    supporting arguments</note> To identify the main idea/plot of the book, and give
                the reader an indication of the writer’s style, and then give a general evaluation
                so the reader can then decide whether or not the book appeals to them.<note
                    type="instructor">okay, but what rhetorical features/patterns provide evidence
                    for this claim? It woul dbe good to introduce how you know this, then use the
                    body paragraphs to elaborate on those sources of evidence</note> Though a book
                review is principally written about the novel itself, an important element to
                include is some information about the author, which Maslin also includes in her
                piece. Including this biographical paragraph on Yanigahara is a tactical rhetorical
                choice made by Maslin to broaden the reader’s view of the book as a whole, instead
                of just focusing on the plotline, as some reviews do. However, Maslin includes some
                critical opinions of some areas in the book, for example; <q>“her mixing of
                    metaphors makes for a mess. The phantoms that haunt Jude can be hyenas with
                    “snapping, foaming jaws” at one moment, “banshees demanding his attention,
                    snatching and tearing at him with their long, needley fingers” the next.”</q>
                <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015).</citation>
                <argument type="main">Another way this genre is used is as an actual review for the
                    author of the book.</argument><note type="instructor">you probably should 1)
                    only have one main argument and 2) limit yourself to one claim per body
                    paragraph</note> When one writes a book, it is often reviewed in the same way a
                restaurant or movie may be reviewed, and its strengths and weaknesses are discussed.
                This is hopefully constructive criticism for the writer, and even though some
                writers don't even read reviews of their books, some find them a very important
                resource and look at them almost as an affirmation that the public either like or
                dislike their writing.<note type="instructor">it seems to me the uptake (and
                    audience) is more rightly about whether or not people want to buy or read the
                    book</note>
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara><situation>Something to consider in this genre is the difference between
                    fiction and non-fiction books being reviewed, as the genre can change
                    significantly depending on what type of book it is.</situation> The reader and
                reviewer pay attention to different things, for example with fiction, more of the
                review is dedicated to discussing the plot, characters, setting, and use of
                language. An interesting sentence that Maslin includes in her review in relation to
                character analysis reads: <q>"This is not a happy story. At its heart is Jude’s
                    secret suffering, and Malcolm and J. B. soon fade into minor characters as race
                    becomes a nonissue."</q>
                <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015)</citation> When
                discussing non-fiction, more focus is given to an author’s main argument and
                    sources.<note type="instructor">okay, I agree, but how are you analyzing this
                    quote--as an example of what conventions?</note>
                <argument type="supporting">The role for the reader in this genre is to read with a
                    purpose, to decide whether to read the book discussed or not. As for the writer
                    of the review, he/she needs to write with the purpose of identifying the
                    author’s main plotlines, assessing the quality and style of the writer’s work,
                    also trying to compare the book to another, or compare the writer with another
                    to give an idea of what sort of reading/writing it is.</argument> The writer
                should also put emphasis on the writer’s organization and style, and finally give a
                conclusion and a recommendation to readers. In Maslin's review, to conclude she
                writes: <q>"Ms. Yanagihara is still capable of introducing great shock value into
                    her story to override its predictability."</q>
                <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015)</citation> Another reader
                role is aimed at giving a librarian a description of a book. These reviews are
                generally shorter, and only give a description of the book and a short evaluation.
                    <participants>The main groups invited to participate in this genre are writers
                    and readers. For writers, those that partake are writers,<note type="instructor"

                    the public can read a general overview before the decide to buy the book in
                    question. For readers, those that want to get a better idea of what a book is
                    about, in other words something more than the blurb on the back of the book
                    itself.</participants></bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>This genre appears in many different forms of print, most often newspapers,
                magazines, journals, and specialized review publications. The most noteworthy review
                section in a newspaper is probably the <citation source="#Times">'Books of the
                    Times'</citation> section in the New York Times, which appears both in print and
                on their website. A review published in a famous or well-known newpaper can create
                'buzz' around a book, which helps the writer promote his/her work, and this is one
                of the principal methods of doing this, as there aren't any trailers like there are
                with a movie, so often a book review can help an author sell copies. Today most of
                these are available online, so you could say that the book review’s main platform
                today is the internet. Websites have been created with the sole purpose of posting
                book reviews, the most noteworthy being <citation source="#GR"
                    >'goodreads.com'</citation> and <citation source="#Kirkus"
                    >'kirkusreviews.com'</citation> However, print is not dead, and book reviews are
                still a huge part of publications such as the New York Times and the Guardian. Even
                though they are receiving a smaller audience because of the increase in digital
                media, they are still being printed and are still being read. </bodyPara>
            <concl>
                <p><argument type="supporting">In summary, book reviews are an incredibly useful
                        tool for the modern reader, it saves time so you don't read something you
                        don't enjoy,</argument> and is <argument type="main">also useful for the

                    interesting section in a newspaper, journal or website, and I find that they are
                    a very good way of finding something that I would like reading<note

                    time to go and peruse a book shop for a few hours, this way you can find a book
                    to read while you're reading the paper, and then order it online, download it on
                    a tablet, or make a much quicker trip to the book shop. </p>

            <p>In this paper, you are analyzing the genre of book reviews and is focusing
                specifically on 'A Little Life' by Hanya Yanigahara. You start off by introducing
                book reviews as a genre, then go on to explain their purpose, and the difference
                between book review for nonfiction and fiction work. It is clear to me that you are
                answering the questions of “Why does this genre exist?” and “Who is invited to use
                this genre? Who is not? How can you tell?” I do not however see a clearly stated
                main argument, so I don’t really know what your essay is trying to convey. Using
                tags might have been helpful for understanding what the main argument is. Also the
                lack of transitions from paragraph to paragraph makes the paper be separate chunks
                of text rather than a flowing essay. I feel like you should probably use more
                examples to support your claims (even though I don’t know what the claims are). It
                looks like the only piece of evidence you have is at the beginning where you wrote
                “her mixing metaphors…the next”. Even still with that evidence, I don’t know what
                they add to the review. I think that you should probably clean up the bottom of your
                second body paragraph, it was just very confusing to understand what you were
                saying. I know that that’s more of a grammar critique, but it would just be helpful.
                Finally, I thought your organization was really good! Your last body paragraph is
                also really nice. It is concise and makes sense and I can understand what you are
                trying to say very easily. </p>

            <p>There are a lot of things going well here. I think in particular you do a nice job of
                identifying evidence in the form of conventions. What needs some attention is your
                paragraph structure--at times you introduce multiple claims/arguments in a single
                body paragraph, other times is is unclear what your claim in a bady paragraph is. If
                restructuring, think about introducing one sub-claim for each body paragraph in the
                topic sentnce, then providing evidence, then analyzing that evidence to connect it
                back to your claim (as we discussed in class). I was also a little confused about
                where your main argument first appeared--it made your overall argument a bit hard to
                pin down. </p>
