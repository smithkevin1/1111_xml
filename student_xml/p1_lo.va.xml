                <p>A book review serves primarily as an informational resource,
                    an assessment and description of a work of fiction or non-fiction. 
                    Janet Maslin begins her review of “A Little Life” by giving a general
>>>>>>> origin/master
                    overview of the book she will be discussing, with details such as when
                    the book was published, size of the novel, her first impressions, most noteably
                    she writes: <q>"It’s a big, emotional, trauma-packed read with a voluptuous prose style
                    that wavers between the exquisite and the overdone.</q>" <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015)</citation> 
                    She also mentions that the book is shortlisted for a prize. 
                    Her introductory paragraph is almost a review within the actual review
                    itself, as it gives a quick overview of the book’s timeline, and a brief
                    description of her thoughts and first impressions.<note type="peer" who="#to.fr"> What is your main argument?</note></p> 
            </intro>
            <bodyPara><argument type="main">This particular genre of book reviews exists to help potential readers
                decide whether they want to read the book themselves.</argument> To identify the main idea/plot
                of the book, and give the reader an indication of the writer’s style, and then give a
                general evaluation so the reader can then decide whether or not the book appeals to them.
                Though a book review is principally written about the novel itself, an important element
                to include is some information about the author, which Maslin also includes in her piece. 
                Including this biographical paragraph on Yanigahara is a tactical rhetorical choice made
                by Maslin to broaden the reader’s view of the book as a whole, instead of just focusing
<<<<<<< HEAD
                on the plotline, as some reviews do. However, Maslin includes some critical opinions of
                some areas in the book, for example; <q>“her mixing of metaphors makes for a mess. The phantoms
                that haunt Jude can be hyenas with “snapping, foaming jaws” at one moment, “banshees demanding
                his attention, snatching and tearing at him with their long, needley fingers” the next.”</q>
                <citation source='#Review'>(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015).</citation> <argument type="main">Another way this genre is used is as an
                actual review for the author of the book.</argument> When one writes a book, it is often reviewed in the same 
                way a restaurant or movie may be reviewed, and its strengths and weaknesses are discussed. This is
                hopefully constructive criticism for the writer, and even though some writers don't even read reviews
                of their books, some find them a very important resource and look at them almost as an affirmation that
                the public either like or dislike their writing.

            <bodyPara>Something to consider in this genre is the difference between fiction and non-fiction
                books being reviewed, as the genre can change significantly depending on what type of book

                more of the review is dedicated to discussing the plot, characters, setting, and use of language. An interesting
                sentence that Maslin includes in her review in relation to character analysis reads: <q>"This is not a happy story.
                At its heart is Jude’s secret suffering, and Malcolm and J. B. soon fade into minor characters as race becomes a nonissue."</q>

>>>>>>> origin/master
                When discussing non-fiction, more focus is given to an author’s main argument and sources.
                <argument type="supporting">The role for the reader in this genre is to read with a purpose, to decide whether to read the book discussed
                or not. As for the writer of the review, he/she needs to write with the purpose of identifying the author’s
                main plotlines, assessing the quality and style of the writer’s work, also trying to compare
<<<<<<< HEAD
                the book to another, or compare the writer with another to give an idea of what sort of
                reading/writing it is.</argument> The writer should also put emphasis on the writer’s organization and
                style, and finally give a conclusion and a recommendation to readers. In Maslin's review, to conclude she writes:
                <q>"Ms. Yanagihara is still capable of introducing great shock value into her story to override its predictability."</q>
                <citation source="#Review">(Review, Janet Maslin NYT 2015)</citation> Another reader role is aimed at giving a librarian
                a description of a book. These reviews are generally shorter, and only give a description of the book and a short evaluation.

            <bodyPara>This genre appears in many different forms of print, most often newspapers, magazines,
                journals, and specialized review publications. The most noteworthy review section in a newspaper is 
                probably the <citation source='#Times'>'Books of the Times'</citation> section in the New York Times, which appears both in print
                and on their website. A review published in a famous or well-known newpaper can
                create 'buzz' around a book, which helps the writer promote his/her work, 
                and this is one of the principal methods of doing this, as there aren't any trailers like there are 
                with a movie, so often a book review can help an author sell copies. Today most of these are available online, so
                you could say that the book review’s main platform today is the internet. Websites have been

                created with the sole purpose of posting book reviews, the most noteworthy being <citation source='#GR'>'goodreads.com'</citation>
                and <citation source='#Kirkus'>'kirkusreviews.com'</citation> However, print is not dead, and book reviews are still a huge part of publications

                such as the New York Times and the Guardian. Even though they are receiving a smaller audience
                because of the increase in digital media, they are still being printed and are still being read.

                <p><argument type="supporting">In summary, book reviews are an incredibly useful tool for the modern reader, it saves time so you don't read

                the author promote the book.</argument> In my opinion, book reviews continue to be an interesting section in a newspaper, journal or website,
                and I find that they are a very good way of finding something that I would like reading These days, less people
                have the time to go and peruse a book shop for a few hours, this way you can find a book to read while you're reading 
                the paper, and then order it online, download it on a tablet, or make a much quicker trip to the book shop. </p>

            <p>In this paper, you are analyzing the genre of book reviews and is focusing specifically on 'A Little Life' by Hanya Yanigahara. 
                You start off by introducing book reviews as a genre, then go on to explain their purpose, and the difference between book review for nonfiction and fiction work. 
                It is clear to me that you are answering the questions of “Why does this genre exist?” and “Who is invited to use this genre? Who is not? How can you tell?”
                I do not however see a clearly stated main argument, so I don’t really know what your essay is trying to convey. Using tags might have been helpful for understanding what the main argument is.  
                Also the lack of transitions from paragraph to paragraph makes the paper be separate chunks of text rather than a flowing essay.
                I feel like you should probably use more examples to support your claims (even though I don’t know what the claims are). 
                It looks like the only piece of evidence you have is at the beginning where you wrote “her mixing metaphors…the next”. 
                Even still with that evidence, I don’t know what they add to the review. 
                I think that you should probably clean up the bottom of your second body paragraph, it was just very confusing to understand what you were saying. 
                I know that that’s more of a grammar critique, but it would just be helpful. 
                Finally, I thought your organization was really good! Your last body paragraph is also really nice. It is concise and makes sense and I can understand what you are trying to say very easily.
