            <p>The draft is well written and adheres to the style of writing of a typical satirical
                article such as one in The Onion. The use of an accurate rhetorical situation which
                is relevant to satirical articles further validates the content in the body
                paragraph. 
                
                Satirical articles are meant to be a humorous take on articles published
                in conventional sources (i.e. The New York Times). I feel that this article has many
                qualities that help it fit into this satirical article category very well. The focus
                of this article is on one particular event in one night, which is what many
                satirical articles are about. The story having a funny character is one definite
                sign that it is a satirical article. There is a good incorporation of current humor–
                the whole concept of mixtapes is very relevant in today’s society where small time
                rappers try to promote themselves through their music. Further, I like how there is
                an insight into the thoughts and feelings of the characters who are involved in the
                scene. Although satirical articles are not meant for character development, I feel
                that a scene is built and situations are developed when there is a general
                understanding of the characters– this was done well by the author. 
                
                One aspect on language which can be slightly improved on is how everything in the article seems to
                be over-emphasized. For example, “kept saying that he raps”, “terrible mistake”,
                “overly heavy bass”, “barely make out”, “played three more”. Some details may be
                better if they’re left un-emphasized. 
                
                Overall, I feel that the article is very well written and sticks by the conventions of satirical articles with good use of
                character & scene development which makes for a thorough rhetorical situation
                development. One little aspect of the article that may be reconsidered is the amount
                of words/ phrases that are emphasized to add effect. It is a good habit to have,
                especially in satirical articles, however not always.</p>
