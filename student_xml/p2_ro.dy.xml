        <intro>
            A common complaint many high school students make is about their lack of sleep. School starts early 
            in the day, it takes time to get ready and get there, and after school many students have sports, 
            jobs, volunteer work, and other activities in addition to homework. Research shows that many teens 
            average less than 7 hours of sleep per night when the optimal amount of sleep per night is around 
            9.25 hours. Currently, many high schools start class around 7:20am. <opinion type="main"> In order to combat teen sleep 
            deprivation, the school starting time should be pushed forward to around 8:30am.</opinion>
        </intro>
        
        <body_para>
            Sleep deprivation is extremely common in teens today. Many teens think that they are expected to function 
            with barely any sleep.<evidence> A lack of sleep causes many problems. It impairs one’s ability to be alert, to solve 
            problems and to cope with stress. Many days without enough sleep also increases the risk of car accidents 
            due to drowsy driving for teens who drive daily.</evidence>
        </body_para>
        <body_para><evidence type="pers_exp">From my time in high school I can say that a lack of sleep was a big problem. There were
            many times that I would fall asleep in class and times that I was just too tired to focus. I would have to 
            go over the material that was taught later in the day. Drowsy driving was definitely a problem as well. 
            I would drove about 20 minutes to school everyday and in the morning it was very challenging to stay 
            awake and focus on the road. Sometimes I would miss  turns and be late to school.</evidence>
        </body_para>
        <body_para><evidence>There is a lot of research into the different sleep cycles between teens and others. Young 
            children’s sleep cycles allow them to wake up earlier and be more energetic than teenagers. The sleep 
            cycle of teens is moved a few hours forward from children’s sleep cycles. Since elementary school 
            starts later than high school, this results in teens waking up at a time that their body thinks 
            is the middle of the night.</evidence> If younger children woke up at the same time they would be fine.</body_para>
        
        <conclusion>Teens need more sleep than they currently get. Moving the start time of high schools about an 
            hour forward would be a step towards helping teens get more sleep. Lower grade schools can be pushed 
            back to start a little earlier because younger children can handle that much better than teens can. So  
            high school should start later than it currently does so that it is less likely that so many teens 
            suffer from sleep depravity.
