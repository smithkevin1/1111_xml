        <intro> A common complaint many high school students make is about their lack of sleep. School 
            starts early in the day, it takes time to get ready and get there, and after school 
            many students have sports, jobs, volunteer work, and other activities in addition to 
            homework. Research shows that many teens average less than 7 hours of sleep per night 
            when the optimal amount of sleep per night is around 9.25 hours. Currently, many high 
            schools start class around 7:20am. <opinion type="main">Sleep deprivation is major problem 
            that many teens have today and in order to combat it the school 
            starting time should be pushed forward to around 8:30am.</opinion>
        </intro>

        <body_para> <bg_info>Sleep deprivation is extremely common in teens today. Many teens think that they are 
            expected to function with barely any sleep which causes people to just ignore how bad sleep 
            deprivation can be.</bg_info> <evidence type="research">A lack of sleep causes many problems. It impairs one’s ability to be 
            alert, to solve problems and to cope with stress. Many days without enough sleep also increases 
            the risk of car accidents due to drowsy driving for teens who drive daily.</evidence> With all of these 
            problems and health risks a lack of sleep cause, it should be obvious that something such as 
            changing school start times needs to be done. Being unable to think properly directly affects a student's
            ability to learn at school. Learning is the whole point of school, so it would be in the school's best
            interest to change start times so that students do not suffer from sleep deprivation and can more properly learn.
        </body_para>
        <body_para>As kids age and become teenagers, their sleep cycles change. Their sleep cycles are shifted 
            forward. This results in more sleep deprivation for teens because of the early high school start 
            times. At times that younger kids are more awake, teens are tired, and vice versa. <evidence type="research">There is research 
            that shows that teens are actually more awake and focused later in the day.</evidence> This would support school 
            start times changing. Middle schools and high schools could switch start times with elementary schools, 
            giving teens more time to sleep and also work with their sleep cycles. Earlier start times for elementary 
            school would not affect students there since children typically go to bed much earlier than teens and their
            sleep cycles help make them feel more energetic in the morning.
            
        </body_para>
        <body_para><evidence type="pers_exp">From my time in high school I can say that a lack of sleep was a big problem for my classmates and me. 
            My friends and other classmates were always complaining about their lack of sleep. There were many times that 
            I would fall asleep in class and times that I was just too tired to focus. I would have to go over the material 
            that was taught later in the day. Drowsy driving was definitely a problem as well. I would drove about 20 minutes 
            to school everyday and in the morning it was very challenging to stay awake and focus on the road. Sometimes I would 
            miss turns and be late to school. After school I would have sports and then homework to finish.</evidence> I feel that a 
            later start time for high school would have helped me get the little extra sleep I needed to feel awake and be 
            focused in class.
        </body_para>

        <conclusion>Teens need more sleep than they currently get. Moving the start time of high schools about an hour forward 
            would be a step towards helping teens get more sleep. Lower grade schools can be pushed back to start a little 
            earlier because younger children can handle that much better than teens can. So high school should start later 
            than it currently does so that it is less likely that many teens suffer from sleep deprivation. If school times do 
            not change, then students will continue to be hindered by sleep deprivation and will not be able to reach their full potential. </conclusion>

            <p>This op-ed is mostly about explaining the effects of sleep deprivation among
                teenagers. Not only does it explain possible problems that it could bring to
                teenagers but also the effects it could have on a person’s daily life. This paper
                also explains what could be done in order to improve this issue that affects
                teenagers nationwide. One thing I would improve is staying within one topic and
                backing it up. You have four different points; sleep deprivation, the effects of
                lack of sleep, research, and what can be done to fix this issue. Although this in
                not a problem and you do a great job staying chronologic, you should make sure that
                you explain each section well so that your reader understands what you are trying to
                express. This is a really interesting topic to read about I would recommend going
                back to your main opinions and making sure that you have included all the possible
                elements that can explain to your reader why you have this opinion and that you are
                well centered on it. Remember that this is your opinion on this topic and your
                opinion does not necessarily need to be backed up in order to be subjective. There
                is not much you need to chance, just keep in mind that this is your opinion that you
                are trying to express to an audience, and such should mainly be expressing what you
                thing and when you are giving evidence make sure to express also what you think of
                that specific piece of evidence. </p>
