                    <synopsis type="themes"> Released in 1995, Tamra Davis’ Billy Madison is considered a cult film, and to many fans, one of the best in the genre of comedy. It stars Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald and Darren McGavin. It was written by Sandler and Robert Simonds. In a nutshell, the movie is about a 27 year old man (Billy Madison) who is the heir to a company built by his father. A spoilt brat, Billy wastes his life with drinking and shenanigans. When his father finally has enough, he decides to name a different successor to his millions, instead of his son. This urges Billy to reconsider his life and prove to his father that he is capable to handling the inheritance by repeating grades 1-12.</synopsis>

                <p> The movie is does not hide the fact that it is a classic, dumb humour kind of
                    movie. And thats why I like it. After reviewing nearly 400 titles on imdb, I
                    have never seen a film that has made me laugh this much. This movie doesnt
                    attempt to be a polished price with intelligent humour. Its slapstick, vulgar,
                    and unquestionably hilarious. Many fans have watched this movie with varying
                    levels of sobriety, all to interesting results.</p>

                <p> It's hard to write a serious review about a movie which isn't serious for a
                    minute. If you tried, you'd probably laugh at the end credits too. This movie
                    was critically panned, and currently holds a score of 40% on rotten tomatoes.
                    Hated by many, and understandably so, this movie only made $25 millon upon
                    release. I strongly believe that this movie has a specific target audience, and
                    it is truly a love-it-or-hate-it movie. The target audience is definitely
                    teenagers, and perhaps older people who have a sense of humour. This movie is
                    definitely not for children, due to frequent bouts of sexual humour, violence
                    and profanity. Yes I agree it has a PG-13 rating, but its important to note that
                    this movie was released in 1995. I'm convinced children today are smarter, and
                    they will understand the hidden jokes and sexual humour.</p>
                <p>
                    <aesthetics>Big, brash and bold. These words perfectly describe the aesthetics
                        in this movie. Think of any lewd or vulgar action, and this movie probably
                        has it. It's interesting to see that the direction isnt bad. Actually, the
                        film is suprisingly well edited, shot and presented. Cinematography is top
                        notch, and not a single shot feels out of place, or awkwardly edited.

            <conclusion>
                <p>
                    <opinions type="reaction">I would strongly advise parents to avoid watching this
                        movie with their children. Though the trailer might seem friendly, it is by
                        no means a family movie.</opinions> Definitely not a one time watch, I would
                    encourage all viewers to watch this hidden gem of a film, as many times as
                    possible. Switch off your logic, and sit back and enjoy the 1 hour and 30
                    minutes of non stop comedy. </p>

            <p>This movie review talks about the movie “Billy Madison” directed by Tamra Davis and starring
                Adam Sandler. It talks a lot about the humor of the movie and how hilarious it was. I like
                the review, it definitely makes me a little interested in watching the movie despite me 
                not liking many comedies involving Adam Sandler. I really like how the review feels like 
                it really is your opinion. You do not go into detail about why things in the movie  worked 
                or if characters were complex or anything, you just say that the movie made you laugh. One 
                thing you could change is to talk more about is what exactly it was about the humor in the 
                movie that made you laugh. You mainly say what type of humor there was and that it was funny, 
                but you could give a few examples. Where there any early movie jokes that stood out? Was there 
                a specific character that kept you laughing the whole time? Those are just a few other things 
                you could talk about so that you can give a bit more information about why the movie was good 
                to readers. Overall though I think the movie review is great and I really like how you talk about 
                the target audience and why the movie might have been critically panned.
