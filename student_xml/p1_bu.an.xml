        <body>
            <intro>
                <p><context>Video games have been an ever growing industry ever since the 1970's
                        with the release of Atari's <q>Atari 2600</q> in 1977. Ever since then,
                        video games have been rapidly advancing technology and supplying thousands
                        all around the world with an immeasurable source of entertainment. Today,
                        video games have finally begun to launch themselves into the public eye with
                        gamers being able to make a living off playing the games they love and
                        compete in massive competitions for millions of dollars in rewards. These
                        competitions, lovingly called <q>eSports</q> by many, have been the source
                        of serious debate amongst gamers for the past couple years for many
                        different games. One such game is an online collectable card game known as
                            <q>Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</q></context>.</p>
                <p><context>Hearthstone is a game developed by Blizzard Entertainment, made to be an
                        easy to learn and simple card game for people to play.</context>
                    <scene>However, this design philosophy to<note type="peer"> Hearthstone is also
                            cross platform, which you might want to mention as a part of bringing in
                            different sources of uptake, such as casual mobile users to the elite
                            Twitch streamers.</note> appeal to a casual gaming audience has spurred
                        the more competitive players across the internet to speak out against
                        Blizzard's approach to the game, in favor for a more serious competition to
                        reward more skilled players. <situation>Those who have voiced their concerns
                            have done so using a very common genre in the gaming community known as
                            a</situation></scene>
                    <genre>gaming article</genre>. <argument type="main">When one analyzes this
                        genre, one can begin to see how their uptake affects both a video game's
                        community and the game they discuss as well.</argument>
                    <q>Three Years In And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf Cards Fast Enough</q> is
                    a gaming article <note type="peer"> I would believe that this example belongs up
                        there with the introduction of "gaming article." It seems out of place when
                        it comes after the main argument. It offers you the opportunity to jump
                        right from main argument to the body paragraph. </note> by Paul Tassi which
                    serves as an excellent example of how this phenomena occurs.</p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>Looking at Tassi's article, one immediately notice<note type="peer">
                    (notices)</note> the author's perspective. <participants>Because of the huge
                    variety of video games available, it is very typical for the author to be a very
                    passionate player of said game, or of video games in general, and to write
                    alone.</participants> As such, it is very easy to see reoccurring patterns in
                many different gaming articles. <aesthetics>Most will be formatted in a similar way:
                    Simple black text with a white background on a website available for anyone to
                    read. Most use short paragraphs to quickly articulate their points, and between
                    these paragraphs are images of the cards or the game-play being talked about,
                    whether it be directly mentioned or just an example of whatever topic is at
                    hand.</aesthetics> Also, most will use the game's jargon, <participants>inviting
                    fellow players of the game, meanwhile excluding those who have never played. As
                    such, they draw relatively the same audience comprised of fellow competitive
                        players<note type="peer"> What about those whom want to learn the game who
                        are casual players.</note> who play and follow the game.</participants> As
                with a lot of gaming articles, the article is an opinion piece; combining the
                personal beliefs of the author and his or her experiences with the game.
                Specifically, this article's subject is how the developers of Hearthstone, Blizzard
                    <note type="peer">Its Blizzard Inc, correct? </note>, are not doing an adequate
                enough job with balancing their game. He expresses his frustration about
                Hearthstone's problems and Blizzard's pattern of changing the game. <q>Eventually,
                    changes were made to specific cards to make those dominating builds less viable,
                    or destroy them completely, but it took forever then, and it’s taking forever
                    now, where the problems seem even more obvious </q><citation source="#Tassi"
                    >("Three Years In And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf Cards Fast
                    Enough"</citation>). Tassi here is clearly quite tired of how Blizzard operates
                its game and is trying to appeal to the audience that Hearthstone is in desperate
                need of a change of management if it wishes to keep its player base<note type="peer"
                    > You might want to speak about the uptake that Blizzard might have on an
                    opinion piece, and why it is difficult to listen to someones opinions online.
                </note>. </bodyPara>

            <bodyPara>But the key to this, and other gaming articles, is the effect it has on the
                game's community. <situation>Due to the heavily subjective nature of the genre, its
                    uptake can radically shift between two very different outcomes. One is that the
                    readers will disagree and argue against what the author is saying. This does not
                    lead to much except discourse within the community, which varies on the
                    popularity of the second outcome. The second, and most important outcome, is
                    when the audience agrees with what the author is saying and goes out of their
                    way to inform others, including the original developers of the game.</situation>
                <argument type="supporting">By sharing the article around with friends and other
                    players, soon enough the article becomes a guideline for how the game should
                    continue to develop. This is especially effective during times where the players
                    are not deriving the much <note type="peer">deriving the much enjoyment does not
                        make sense in this case </note>enjoyment from the game or the game has a few
                    glaring issues hampering it.</argument>
                <evidence>Hearthstone was at this very point at the time Tassi was writing his
                    article, as he explains, </evidence><q>I like Hearthstone, but I do not like
                    playing games, seeing a class, and knowing there’s about an 80% chance I’m going
                    to lose. I like Hearthstone, but I do not like playing or playing against a
                    single card that can often decide an entire game on a coin flip</q>
                <citation source="#Tassi">("Three Years In And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf
                    Cards Fast Enough")</citation>. <evidence>In his piece he offers some changes
                    that Blizzard could make in order to improve the issues, and soon enough the
                    entire competitive Hearthstone community was nearly rioting for these changes to
                    be made. Tassi certainly was not the first one to write about this issue,
                    however, but his article really demonstrates the mood and frustration of the
                    community at the time.</evidence> Finally, gaming articles also tie into several
                different genres, such as <genre>video game reviews, <note type="peer"> I believe
                        that Hearthstone is an RNG game, so coin flip does sound like its rooted in
                        the game mechanics.</note>blog posts, forum discussions, and so on</genre>,
                as its topics and format are so simple to use and understand. This pervasiveness is
                a big reason why it is so effective when it comes to reaching out to the
                audience.</bodyPara>
            <concl>
                <p>Here is where video games, in recent years, make themselves completely different
                    from any other form of media. <argument type="supporting">At a certain point,
                        the developers will actually step in and make the changes the community
                        recommends. Improving the quality of the product so more and more people can
                        get enjoyment from it.</argument>
                    <evidence>After the massive fan outcry and onslaught of gaming articles,
                        including Tassi's own work, Blizzard finally decided to change a couple
                        cards within the game that were frequently protested against, many of which
                        were the same cards Tassi was displeased with. This re-balancing of the game
                        was the uptake of gaming articles</evidence>, which often influenced several
                    other genres related to Hearthstone such as <genre>community discussion, forum
                        posts, reviews, and videos on the subject.</genre> What these articles do in
                    the grand scheme of Hearthstone and many other game's development is that they
                    subtly shape what the game is to become. And after some time, more problems will
                    be found with the game, and the whole process will start over. This process of
                    community revision has been how many popular games have survived for so long. It
                    all comes back to a video game's primary purpose, to entertain the player. If a
                    large enough subset of players is not entertained, then something needs to be
                    done or else the game is not successful. Luckily, Hearthstone has a massive fan
                    base of creative and passionate players who push Blizzard to make Hearthstone
                    constantly better and better.</p>

            <p> I understand fully that this is a genre analysis of gaming articles, more
                specifically non-journalistic gaming opinion pieces posted on the web which generate
                page views. I understand that there are rhetorical ways in which the genre of gaming
                article appears online, and what content it covers such as what works and doesn't
                work in the game. Furthermore, I understand that there was two uptakes present, the
                developers and the player base, but not the casual crowd. .</p>
            <p> Critique. The introduction is certainly a good base jump into your material. It's
                length focuses on the different aspects of the gaming world, esports, competitive
                players. However esports is your essay apart from the introduction. I am wondering
                if it serves the purpose of ensuring that the reader understands the level of
                dedication to the game, and that dedication validates the genre of non-professional
                gaming article I know you only analyze one user's gaming article, but are there
                different types of articles, other than opinion pieces? I know that professional
                pieces that promote and evaluate exist such as IGN. Perhaps if you want to
                strengthen your argument you might want to draw attention to that fact in your first
                paragraph where you begin to mention the aesthetics of the opinion article. It would
                help contrast for whom the article was intended for when you have a vibrant IGN
                opinion piece vs a diehard user/fan opinion piece. Blizzard as mentioned in the
                first paragraph uptakes the opinion pieces. Does blizzard have developer blogs, a
                genre that is directly tied to opinion pieces. It serves as a response, and it also
                contrasts between what is posted for change and what is actually changed; uptake?
                Actually your argument about the reception of opinion articles where you mention
                that some users talk to the developers you should consider how one genre has created
                another genre, the forum. If you think it would strengthen the interplay between
                genres in your argument, you might want to add that. I especially like the second
                paragraphs concluding point about the pervasiveness of the genres and why this genre
                inspires successful diplomacy. I remember now, that you mention all the other genres
                that are also inspired by the game in your conclusion, and they all serve a purpose
                to revise. I think your conclusion is especially strong, since you dissected the
                purpose of all types of reviews in general. I know your essay is longer than what
                was prescribed, but you have plenty of evidence and claims and analysis to go
                without my suggestions. It can be a standalone the way it right now. </p>
