            <intro>
                <p><context>Video games have been an ever growing industry ever since the 1970's
                        with the release of Atari's <q>Atari 2600</q> in 1977. Ever since then,
                        video games have been <note type="instructor">a rapidly advancing
                            tech...?</note>rapidly advancing technology and supplying thousands all
                        around the world with an immeasurable source of entertainment. Today, video
                        games have finally begun to launch themselves into the public eye with
                        gamers being able to make a living off playing the games they love and
                        compete in massive competitions for millions of dollars in rewards.<note
                            type="instructor">so the money asect does seem new, but the "public
                            eye?" I'd say that video games have been relatively mainstream for at
                            least a few decades.</note> These competitions, lovingly called
                            <q>eSports</q> by many, have been the source of serious debate<note
                            type="instructor">what is the debate?</note> amongst gamers for the past
                        couple years for many different games. One such game is an online
                        collectable card game known as <q>Hearthstone: Heroes of
                        Warcraft</q></context>.</p>
                <p><context>Hearthstone is a game developed by Blizzard Entertainment, made to be an
                        easy to learn and simple card game for people to play available on a
                        multitude of gaming platforms.</context>
                    <scene>However, this design philosophy to<note type="peer"> Hearthstone is also
                            cross platform, which you might want to mention as a part of bringing in
                            different sources of uptake, such as casual mobile users to the elite
                            Twitch streamers.</note> appeal to a casual gaming audience has spurred
                        the more competitive players across the internet to speak out against
                        Blizzard's approach to the game, in favor for a more serious competition to
                        reward more skilled players.<note type="instructor">meaning what, exactly?
                            That they don't like this particular game? Or that they think that the
                            game should be administered in a different way?</note> Those who have
                        voiced their concerns have done so using a very common genre in the gaming
                        community known as a</scene>
                    <genre>gaming article</genre>. <argument type="main">When one analyzes this
                        genre, one can begin to see how their uptake affects both a video game's
                        community and the game they discuss as well.</argument>
                    <q>Three Years In And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf Cards Fast Enough</q> is
                    a gaming article <note type="peer"> I would believe that this example belongs up
                        there with the introduction of "gaming article." It seems out of place when
                        it comes after the main argument. It offers you the opportunity to jump
                        right from main argument to the body paragraph. </note> by Paul Tassi which
                    serves as an excellent example of how this phenomena occurs.<note
                        type="instructor">I agree with the peer reviewer that you might introduce
                        the article a bit earlier and end the intro with the main
                    argument</note></p>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>Looking at Tassi's article, one immediately notices the author's perspective.
                    <participants>Because of the huge variety of video games available, it is very
                    typical for the author to be a very passionate player of said game, or of video
                    games in general, and to write alone.<note type="instructor">excellent info
                        here</note></participants> As such, it is very easy to see reoccurring
                patterns in many different gaming articles. <aesthetics>Most will be formatted in a
                    similar way: Simple black text with a white background on a website available
                    for anyone to read. Most use short paragraphs to quickly articulate their
                    points, and between these paragraphs are images of the cards or the game-play
                    being talked about, whether it be directly mentioned or just an example of
                    whatever topic is at hand.</aesthetics> Also, most will use the game's jargon,
                    <participants>inviting fellow players of the game, meanwhile excluding those who
                    have never played or who are as serious about playing. As such, they draw
                    relatively the same audience comprised of fellow competitive players<note
                        type="peer"> What about those whom want to learn the game who are casual
                        players.</note> who play and follow the game.<note type="instructor">you
                        might also note what the use of jargon and first-person experience does for
                        the author's credibility with readers</note></participants> As with a lot of
                gaming articles, the article is an opinion piece; combining the personal beliefs of
                the author and his or her experiences with the game. Specifically, this article's
                subject is how the developers of Hearthstone, Blizzard <note type="peer">Its
                    Blizzard Inc, correct? </note>, are not doing an adequate enough job with
                balancing their game. He expresses his frustration about Hearthstone's problems and
                Blizzard's pattern of changing the game. <q>Eventually, changes were made to
                    specific cards to make those dominating builds less viable, or destroy them
                    completely, but it took forever then, and itâ€™s taking forever now, where the
                    problems seem even more obvious </q><citation source="#Tassi">("Three Years In
                    And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf Cards Fast Enough"</citation>).<note
                    type="instructor">you might consider an introductory phrase when deploying
                    quotations; something like, "For example, Tassi opines, "Eventually...."</note>
                Tassi here is clearly quite tired of how Blizzard operates its game and is trying to
                appeal to the audience that Hearthstone is in desperate need of a change of
                management if it wishes to keep its player base<note type="instructor">I think you
                    need a bit more here, Perhaps, as Arlen notes, about the desired uptakes of the
                    article--how does the author want his or her article taken up amongst the
                    community? Or about what the author is taking up--is this a common/ongoing
                    debate in the community that the author is taking up in a specific
                    way?</note><note type="peer"> You might want to speak about the uptake that
                    Blizzard might have on an opinion piece, and why it is difficult to listen to
                    someones opinions online. </note>. </bodyPara>

            <bodyPara>But the key to this, and other gaming articles, is the effect it has<note
                    type="instructor">the various uptakes of the article?</note> on the game's
                community. <situation>Due to the heavily subjective nature of the genre, its uptake
                    can radically shift between two very different outcomes. One is that the readers
                    will disagree and argue against what the author is saying. This does not lead to
                    much except discourse within the community, which varies on the popularity of
                    the second outcome. The second, and most important outcome<note
                        type="instructor">maybe describe this as a potential or desired uptake,
                        rather than an outcome</note>, is when the audience agrees with what the
                    author is saying and goes out of their way to inform others, including the
                    original developers of the game.</situation>
                <argument type="supporting">By sharing the article around with friends and other
                    players, soon enough the article becomes a guideline for how the game should
                    continue to develop. This is especially effective during times where the players
                    are not deriving much enjoyment from the game or the game has a few glaring
                    issues hampering it.<note type="instructor">is this the specific situation of
                        this article?</note></argument>
                <evidence>Hearthstone was at this very point at the time Tassi was writing his
                    article, as he explains, </evidence><q>I like Hearthstone, but I do not like
                    playing games, seeing a class, and knowing thereâ€™s about an 80% chance Iâ€™m going
                    to lose. I like Hearthstone, but I do not like playing or playing against a
                    single card that can often decide an entire game on a coin flip</q>
                <citation source="#Tassi">("Three Years In And 'Hearthstone' Still Doesn't Nerf
                    Cards Fast Enough")</citation><note type="instructor">so this to me is pertinent
                    information that you would call a recurrent rhetorical situation--and the genre
                    of the gaming article is a typified response to that recurrent situation. It
                    might make sense to think about introducing this in your first body paragraph
                    (before you start talking about uptakes, necessarily)</note>. <evidence>In his
                    piece he offers some changes that Blizzard could make in order to improve the
                    issues, and soon enough the entire competitive Hearthstone community was nearly
                    rioting for these changes to be made.<note type="instructor">evidence, in this
                        case, I think would include some textual examples of the "rioting" for
                        changes (perhaps some quotes from other articles/posts, etc.)</note> Tassi
                    certainly was not the first one to write about this issue, however, but his
                    article really demonstrates the mood and frustration of the community at the
                    time.</evidence> Finally, gaming articles also tie into several different
                genres, such as <genre>video game reviews, <note type="peer"> I believe that
                        Hearthstone is an RNG game, so coin flip does sound like its rooted in the
                        game mechanics.</note>blog posts, forum discussions, and so on</genre>, as
                its topics and format are so simple to use and understand. This pervasiveness is a
                big reason why it is so effective when it comes to reaching out to the
                    audience.<note type="instructor">why? do Tassi's words/opinions get taken up in
                    these other related genres?</note></bodyPara>
            <concl>
                <p>Here<note type="instructor">a little bit unclear what 'here' i sreferring
                        to</note> is where video games, in recent years, make themselves completely
                    different from any other form of media. <argument type="supporting">At a certain
                        point, the developers will<note type="instructor">might*</note> actually
                        step in and make the changes the community recommends. Improving the quality
                        of the product so more and more people can get enjoyment from it.</argument>
                    <evidence>After the massive fan outcry and onslaught of gaming articles,
                        including Tassi's own work, Blizzard finally decided to change a couple
                        cards within the game that were frequently protested against, many of which
                        were the same cards Tassi was displeased with. This re-balancing of the game
                        was the uptake of gaming articles</evidence>, which often influenced several
                    other genres related to Hearthstone such as <genre>community discussion, forum
                        posts, reviews, and videos on the subject.</genre> What these articles do in
                    the grand scheme of Hearthstone and many other game's development is that they
                    subtly shape what the game is to become. And after some time, more problems will
                    be found with the game, and the whole process will start over. This process of
                    community revision<note type="instructor">cool term!</note> has been how many
                    popular games have survived for so long. It all comes back to a video game's
                    primary purpose, to entertain the player. If a large enough subset of players is
                    not entertained, then something needs to be done or else the game is not
                    successful. Luckily, Hearthstone has a massive fan base of creative and
                    passionate players who push Blizzard to make Hearthstone constantly better and
                    better.</p>

            <p> I understand fully that this is a genre analysis of gaming articles, more
                specifically non-journalistic gaming opinion pieces posted on the web which generate
                page views. I understand that there are rhetorical ways in which the genre of gaming
                article appears online, and what content it covers such as what works and doesn't
                work in the game. Furthermore, I understand that there was two uptakes present, the
                developers and the player base, but not the casual crowd. .</p>
            <p> Critique. The introduction is certainly a good base jump into your material. It's
                length focuses on the different aspects of the gaming world, esports, competitive
                players. However esports is your essay apart from the introduction. I am wondering
                if it serves the purpose of ensuring that the reader understands the level of
                dedication to the game, and that dedication validates the genre of non-professional
                gaming article I know you only analyze one user's gaming article, but are there
                different types of articles, other than opinion pieces? I know that professional
                pieces that promote and evaluate exist such as IGN. Perhaps if you want to
                strengthen your argument you might want to draw attention to that fact in your first
                paragraph where you begin to mention the aesthetics of the opinion article. It would
                help contrast for whom the article was intended for when you have a vibrant IGN
                opinion piece vs a diehard user/fan opinion piece. Blizzard as mentioned in the
                first paragraph uptakes the opinion pieces. Does blizzard have developer blogs, a
                genre that is directly tied to opinion pieces. It serves as a response, and it also
                contrasts between what is posted for change and what is actually changed; uptake?
                Actually your argument about the reception of opinion articles where you mention
                that some users talk to the developers you should consider how one genre has created
                another genre, the forum. If you think it would strengthen the interplay between
                genres in your argument, you might want to add that. I especially like the second
                paragraphs concluding point about the pervasiveness of the genres and why this genre
                inspires successful diplomacy. I remember now, that you mention all the other genres
                that are also inspired by the game in your conclusion, and they all serve a purpose
                to revise. I think your conclusion is especially strong, since you dissected the
                purpose of all types of reviews in general. I know your essay is longer than what
                was prescribed, but you have plenty of evidence and claims and analysis to go
                without my suggestions. It can be a standalone the way it right now. </p>

            <p>I think this is a fascinating look at the gaming scene, and Hearthstone in
                particular. I have a few notes for you to think about. 1) Structure: you do a good
                job contextualizing the game in the intro, but I wonder if you might swap the
                rhetorical situation (people being upset with the game) with the section about
                uptakes. This way we see how the genre functions within a particular situation in
                the scene. 2) Supporting argument: You might clue the reader in that your ultimate
                argument is going to be about "communit revision" (a really cool term) before we get
                to the conclusion. Some mention of this concept in the intro would be good, so that
                while you are doing your work establishing situation and uptakes that the reader
                knows where you are heading. 3) Evidence: could be a little stronger, especially
                when you are talking about uptakes; give the reader some examples (see in-text
                notes). Overall though, this is really a solid effort and I think it is clear you
                are understanding the concepts of genre and the attendant vocabulary we have been
                using to discuss it. Nice work!</p>
