            <bodyPara/> <bodyPara> A world news article serves a specific purpose in a newspaper. These articles
                are written to inform the audience of events that are going on and that the audience has
                an interest in. News networks and journals today are extremely detailed and in-depth,
                covering relevant news from all over the World. CNN, one of the most accredited and
                widely recognized news channels has adopted different genres when responding to global
                news in the past compared to today. In this essay I will be looking at the various
                differences in genre between the year 2000, and the present, 2016. These differences in
                genre will be explored with regards to language used to evaluate a situation (between
                two news articles published in different years). I will also be discussing the uptakes
                between the two genres of the news articles</bodyPara> </p></body>
