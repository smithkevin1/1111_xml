                <p>The first genre‑based analysis was done by John Swales in 1981. He investigated
                    48 research article (RA) introductions from different fields of science and
                    presented his findings in the work “aspects of Article Introductions”, offering
                    a four‑move model. Swales claims that article introductions have the structure
                    within which a series of moves (parts) appear in a predictable order <citation
                        source="#Swales">(Swales 244)</citation>. Each move consists of several
                    steps. In 1990, Swales offered a revised model consisting of three moves, urged
                    by some criticisms that it was difficult to differentiate between Move 1 and
                    Move 2. However, it is debatable whether the 3‑move model solves this problem. I
                    would argue that the choice between 3-move and 4-move model primarily depends on
                    the discipline in which the genre is applied.</p>

                <p>There have been numerous attempts to investigate research article introductions
                    in different scientific fields such as physics, medicine, engineering, biology
                    etc <citation source="#Duvall">(Duvall)</citation>. However, I have not found
                    any attempt of a detailed analysis of RA introductions in economics. The only
                    article regarding this issue is that by Dudley‑Evans and Henderson dealing with
                    the change in economics writing from <note type="instructor" who="#smi.ke">test note</note>1881 to
                    1980. They have identified three periods: (1) 1881 to 1925, (2) 1935 to 1957 and
                    (3) 1961 to 198O, but only a small number of articles was examined (10, 5 and 7
                    respectively).</p>
