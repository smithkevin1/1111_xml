            <intro>Ebay is an online marketplace where users can buy and sell various items. Buyers and sellers make accounts 
                on the website, and can either auction off their belongings or purchase products from others. <context>Ebay is unique 
                in that anyone is allowed to sell products, as long as they create an account and pay a small fee. Secure 
                payment methods allow consumers and vendors to be confident that they get their product and their money respectively. </context>
                Today there are over 150 million users on Ebay <citation source="#Smith">(Smith).</citation> <argument type="main">In the genre of Ebay listings, recurring language and actions affect what happens in the genre.</argument>
            </intro>
            <bodyPara>Two of the most popular items currently on Ebay are GoPro cameras and Michael Kors handbags <citation source="#Ebay">(“What’s Selling Hot on Ebay”).</citation> 
                Searching for a GoPro camera leads to a listing for a camera with some of the most active bidders. Despite the product 
                being pre-owned, there is significant interest in it, demonstrated by the number of bids. This can be credited in part due to 
                the seller’s understanding of the genre of Ebay listings. <evidence>The seller recognizes that the person that’s viewing their listing is
                likely interested in a fast and cheap way to acquire the camera. The language and descriptions used to inform the reader of the
                product are concise, while still communicating the necessary details.</evidence> This is representative of the communication used throughout 
                the genre. The language is similarly clear and simple in most listings, regardless of what product it is. <genre>Customers use these same
                rhetorical ways of communicating, where simplicity and minimalism is valued above all.</genre> This common language is a result of the 
                shared intentions of all of the participants in the genre. Both <participants>buyers and sellers</participants> are interested in doing business as quickly and 
                easily as possible, and are interested in getting the best deal for themselves. In the buyer’s case, this means understanding all 
                of the information about the product, and the seller wants to get as many people as possible interested in buying their product so 
                the auction price will increase. These similar, shared goals shape the whole genre of Ebay listings, as well as the resulting 
                interactions and uptake.
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>The casing of the camera is scratched and the plastic is fading, but the seller has pictures of all of the imperfections, 
                and explains that the functionality hasn’t been affected. Because of the condition of the product, the auction price is much lower 
                than new versions of the GoPro camera that can be found on Ebay, which is likely one of the reasons for this listing’s popularity.
                <evidence>This could be an example of kairos, where the seller understands what to say in the right situation to turn a flaw into something
                advantageous.</evidence> <situation>When a bidder finally wins, the genre changes, and only two specific participants are involved. The user that won the
                bid or purchased the product will convey specific information to the seller. Often a buyer first sends out their payment along with
                their address and any other specific requests, and the seller will send a tracking number for the package soon after.</situation> This is one 
                example of uptake being invited from the genre of an Ebay listing. This process will not be taken up by the listing genre for the 
                bidders that don’t win; they’ll likely try to bid on the same product being sold by a different seller.
            </bodyPara>
            <bodyPara>After scrolling through “buy it now” listings when searching for Michael Kors handbags, numerous almost identical listings 
                can be found. Upon clicking on one, it can be seen that the listing hasn’t garnered much interest because of the seller’s lack of
                understanding of the genre. The item description contains no words at all, and the image is a stock photo from the internet, not 
                a real picture of the specific item that will be shipped. It could be inferred that the seller isn’t aware of the rhetorical 
                language and actions, or they might not value the interest of the customers, which results in a less popular listing. <evidence>This seller 
                has a similar purpose to any other seller on the site, which is to get someone to buy their product. However, in this situation 
                the seller might not have a full grasp on what will interest possible buyers, and thus their inadequate communication of the 
                information surrounding the product results in no interest.</evidence>
            </bodyPara>
            <concl>Because of the intentions of the buyers and sellers on Ebay, typified rhetorical actions can be seen in every listing. The use
                of language to better advertise products is the most common occurrence, but consumers also use their own rhetorical language to
                benefit themselves and others. Uptake occurs when the possible buyers ask questions publicly to the seller, or when someone chooses
                to purchase the product and the genre of negotiating information takes place. The constant interaction between buyers and sellers
                that is necessary because of their shared objectives as users results in a genre where participants make distinct rhetorical choices.
