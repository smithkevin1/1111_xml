            <p class="greeting">Hello,If you don't know who its going to say "Hiring
                Committee"</p>
            <p class="intro">
            I am interested in the Analyst position within the Ameresco
                Project Management team.
             During my time at BlueWave Capital, I
                recieved some exposure to Ameresco submittals and was immediately impressed by the
                quality of work. was immediately impressed with... their work
                    ethic? their project difficulty or varety or impact?
             After evaluating Ameresco's development history and continual production of
            quality projects, I became interested in persuingpursuing a role on their project management team. maybe
                say you became increasingly interested in the company, because right now you haven't
                really mentioned anything position specific or specific to the management team. If
                you make it clear you are impressed with the work of the management group then I
                think it would make sense to say you are interested in the position
                specifically.
             I have enjoyed my work with Solar Project Development in the
                past and I think I will fit well with Ameresco's challenging
                culture and contribute to your goal of expanding sustainable energy generation.good specificity here
            
        </p>
            <p class="background">
            
            Throughout my three co-ops at Northeastern University, I was
                able to hone my AutoCAD and Excel skills in a manner that
                increased the efficiency of my work as well as that of my peers'.
                    Excel proved to be increasingly useful as
                    I recognized areas of inneficiency within my previous companies'
                    workflow and was able to develop macros to
                    automate previously manual processes.
            
             At Northeastern, I gained cosider: "I
                    gained valuable technical communication skills"technical
                    communication skills from my work within the Sustainable Energy Systems
                minor. Through various projects within the graduate classes associated with this
                program I was able to utilize the knowledge gained in my earlier classes as well as
                on my co-ops to work towards unique solutions to proposed issues. Advanced classes
                within this minor evaluated the leglislative, economic, and environmental issues
                assocated with solar energy.This is a very long sentence, consider
                    breaking it down for clarity.
            
             My capstone projectIf by final project you
                    are reffering to capstone, make sure you talk about it in presenent tense if you
                    plan to send this letter out prior to graduation. Otherwise this sentence makes
                    it sound like you are already done with school. at Northeastern will
                allow me to improve my ability to communicate effectively with various
                    specialists working towards a common goal. Our project goal, to design
                a potable water distribution system as well as an energy generation facility in
                Haiti, will give me the opportunity toconsider rewording from "let
                    you" to "required you to" or something a little less flimsy. It will help make
                    it clear you learned valuable information from these people rather than just
                    chitchatted or something! communicate with environmental and electric
                specialists as I fill the role of solar development specialist. 
        </p>
        
            I believe my skills and passion for renewable energy will help me to fit
                in well with thechange "a" to "the", you want to fit in with the
                    company as a whole Ameresco team and have a positive impact on the
                Project Management Team.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Please reach out to me at the contacts listed above to discuss the
                possibility of an interview. I look forward to hearing from you. Consider rewording, sounds a bit robotic and unfeeling. Maybe also saying that
                    you look forward to hearing back from them so that they know you are genuinely
                    interested in them!
