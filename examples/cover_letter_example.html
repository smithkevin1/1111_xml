            <p class="greeting">Hello,</p>
            <p class="intro">
            I am interested in the Analyst position within the Ameresco
                Project Management team.
             During my time at BlueWave Capital, I
                recieved some exposure to Ameresco submittals and was immediately impressed by the
                quality of work. 
             After evaluating Ameresco's development history and continual production of
            quality projects, I became interested in persuing a role on their project management team. 
             I have enjoyed my work with Solar Project Development in the
                past and I think I will fit well with Ameresco's challenging
                culture and contribute to your goal of expanding sustainable energy generation.
            
        </p>
            <p class="background">
            
            Throughout my three co-ops at Northeastern University, I was
                able to hone my AutoCAD and Excel skills in a manner that
                increased the efficiency of my work as well as that of my peers'.
                    Excel proved to be increasingly useful as
                    I recognized areas of inneficiency within my previous companies'
                    workflow and was able to develop macros to
                    automate previously manual processes.
            
             At Northeastern, I gained technical
                    communication skills from my work within the Sustainable Energy Systems
                minor. Through various projects within the graduate classes associated with this
                program I was able to utilize the knowledge gained in my earlier classes as well as
                on my co-ops to work towards unique solutions to proposed issues. Advanced classes
                within this minor evaluated the leglislative, economic, and environmental issues
                assocated with solar energy.
            
             My capstone project at Northeastern will
                allow me to improve my ability to communicate effectively with various
                    specialists working towards a common goal. Our project goal, to design
                a potable water distribution system as well as an energy generation facility in
                Haiti, will give me the opportunity to communicate with environmental and electric
                specialists as I fill the role of solar development specialist. 
        </p>
        
            I believe my skills and passion for renewable energy will help me to fit
                in well with the Ameresco team and have a positive impact on the
                Project Management Team.
            <br/>

                possibility of an interview. I look forward to hearing from you.
