            <h1>The Genre of Restaurant Menus: A Comparative Analysis</h1>
        
            <div id="text">
            
                
               <p class="intro">College students have many options throughout the city when it comes to Italian
                    dining. One popular spot near campus is BelaRoma Pizza and Pasta, which caters
                    to a college crowd and advertises on its menu the restaurant's goal of
                         "Satisfying Your Cravings" <a class="cit" href="#BelaRoma">("BelaRoma Deli
                        Menu").</a> Located further from the campus strip is another Italian
                    restaurant, Sicily's, that caters more to the larger community and offers a more
                    formal dining experience. On its menu, you will find a different advertisement:
                         "Silver Platter Award Winner for Best Italian Food." </p>
                
               <p class="intro">The differences in the implications of these quotations taken from the menu
                    covers shows the differences in the communities these restaurants are trying to
                    create and the customers they are trying to serve. BelaRoma's main purpose is to
                    serve takeout and delivery food to on-the-go students, while Sicily's restaurant
                    serves a sit-down clientele. Though Sicily's Italian Restaurant and BelaRoma
                    Deli are both restaurants that offer Italian style dining, as demonstrated by
                    their menus, the fact that they represent different communities is evident in
                    the layout, pricing, and language of their menus.</p>
            
            
               <p class="bodyPara"> Sicily's and BelaRoma, while being very different types of restaurants, share
                some basic similarities in their menus, reflecting the shared goals of the
                restaurant business.Each of the menus clearly displays the restaurant's name
                    in large letters, with a graphic underneath the title to catch the customer's
                    attention ad to make the restaurant memorable to the customers so that they will
                    keep coming back. When the customers first open the menus, a variety of food
                    options are revealed, conveniently following the order that they usually are
                    consumed, with appetizers listed first, followed by main dishes and then
                desserts. Each variety of food is broken down under different headings, such as
                "Appetizers" or "Pasta," thus making the menu easier to read and helping to guide
                customers as they make their choices. </p>
            
               <p class="bodyPara">The language on the menus fit the different price ranges and different
                clienteles of each restaurant. The use of elevated language in the Sicily's menu
                reflects the higher prices of its items and the more formal dining experience they
                provide. There are entrees on the menu at Sicily's such as Zuppa del Giorno and
                Chicaken Saltimboca. Most of the items on BelaRoma's menu consist of more familiar
                names like "Spaghetti" and "Reuben." This reflects the difference in types of food
                and claims to authenticity or ability to specialize in Italian food that each
                establishment offers as well as the different customers they are trying to attract.
                Sicily's restaurant is looking for more serious diners who would be interested in
                trying a menu item named "Linguine Pescatore" while BelaRoma is trying to attract
                customers--most likely college students--who want to be able to order a "Bacon Swiss
                Burger" or "Cheese Sticks," in addition to Italian fare. The language of the menus,
                like the prices, lends a particular atmosphere to the foods offered by each
                restaurant.</p>
            
                
               <p class="concl">The differences in the menus of BelaRoma Pizza and Pasta and Sicily's Italian
                    Restaurant reflect the fact that these eateries belong to different communities
                    of eating establishments. Each is using its menu to try to attract and appeal to
                    a specific clientele: Sicily's is trying to attract a smaller group of people
                    who are more selctive and who only want Italian food while BelaRoma is trying to
                    appeal to their diverse clientele of mostly college students with many different
                    eating habits and tastes. While they share the similar goal of trying to get
                    people to eat at their establishments and order their food, their strategies in
                    menu layout, pricing, language, and menu items reflect differences in target
                    customers.</p>
